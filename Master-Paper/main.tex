\begin{abstract}
Cyber-insurance is a powerful economic concept that can
help companies in the fight against cybercrime. From the early 80s, several
researchers claimed that cyber-insurance had a bright future, were it
would become a huge economical tool for handling residual cyber-risks.
However, both the European and US cyber-insurance market have failed
to grasp its promising potential. To fully grasp this potential they need
innovative approaches to handle the unique problems of cyber-insurance.
This paper find and characterize network structures with properties that
make them superior as cyber-insurance. And creates several models for
forming these network structures. In every model, new properties that
relate the model to the real-world and real-world insurance products are
added. The results show that insurers can use the insurance premium as
a tool for determining the resulting formation of the network, and if set
to the right level, these superior structures will evolve.
We believe our findings could help the cyber-insurance market evolve, by
giving the insurers a proper tool to better analyze and control formation
of cyber-insurance networks.
