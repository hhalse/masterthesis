\chapter{Modeling Cyber-Insurance }
\label{chp:modelingCyberInsurance} 

In many scenarios nodes seeks to create networks in order to directly benefit from each other. The established links might represent companies out sourcing part of their manufacturing, or cooperative agreements in the development of new software products. In addition to increase the trade-off, each of the established links represents risk of being a victim of cascading failures. The intuitive example is the spread of epidemic diseases, also node failures of a power grid and financial contagion such as the one back in 2008 was a result of cascading failures. Strategic network formation using cyber-insurance can be used to prevent such situation in addition to increase the overall payoff of participants in a clustered network.


When deciding whether to establish connection to a neighbor agent, the payoff has to be higher in the balance between the expected earnings and the risk of the other party failing to complete the transaction. This is the reason why we seek to only download content from trusted peers and outlaw MC-gangs are consistently skeptical to enter into new agreements despite promising increased earnings, since the risk of undercover police are too high. 

\subparagraph{FLYTT DETTE TIL BACKGROUND og referer til det n√•r vi viser at cliques er bra}
The paper \cite{contagion} come up with some interesting results regarding network formation games. 
They set up a game where the nodes benefit from direct links, but these links also expose them for risk. 
Each node gains a payoff of  $a$ per link it establishes, but it can establish a maximum of $\delta$ links.
A failure occur at a node with probability $q$, and propagates on a link with probability $p$. If a nodes fail, it will receive a negative payoff of $b$, no matter how many links it has established.

The results from their model shows a situation where clustered graphs achieve a higher payoff when connected to trusted agents, compared to when connecting with random nodes. Unlike in anonymous graphs, where nodes connect to each other at random, nodes in these graphs share some information with their neighbors, which is used when deciding whether to form a link or not. 
To further explain these results, they show that there exists a critical point, called \textit{phase transition}, which occurs when nodes have a node degree of $frac{1}{p}$. 
At this point a node gets a payoff of $frac{a}{p}$, and to further increase the payoff the node needs to go into a region with significantly higher failure probability. 
Because once each node establish more than $frac{1}{p}$ links, the contagious edges, will with high probability form a large cluster. Which results in a rise in probability of node failure, and reduces the overall welfare.
From this the paper say that when the minimum welfare exceeds 
$(1+f(\delta)*frac{a}{p})$
we have reached super critical payoff. Otherwise it is called sub-critical payoff. 
Further they show that the only possible way of ending up with supercritical payoff, is by forming clustered networks consisting of cliques with slightly more than $frac{1}{p}$ nodes. 
If the nodes form an anonymous market, random linking, they can only get sub-critical payoff. 
In other words, if the nodes can choose who they connect with, and by doing so, creating trusted clustered markets, they can achieve a higher payoff, by exceeding the critical node degree point. But in random graphs, this is not possible. 


Inspired by this model, we are step wise building a model which shields light on how cyber-insurance can be used in network formation games to prevent cascading failures and increase an agents payoff.  

\section{Model 1 - Initial Model \label{section:verysimplemodel}}

There are many examples of nodes needing to establish connections, one example is a company needing to out-source certain tasks to remain competitive. This outsourcing involves some risks, such as, will the company deliver at the reported time, to the reported costs, what happens if they fail to deliver, what if they go bankrupt etc. If the companies that are going to establish links(cooperative contracts), know that the other firms are insured, it will be more secure and reliable to enter into an cooperative agreement. In this way trusted cliques can evolve. The firms benefit from connecting to other insured firms, and the insurance company can offer fair prices to the insured companies, because the risk is calculable in a trusted clique.

As a starting point the model is highly simplified in order to show the concept of how cyber-insurance can be used to create an insurable topology. We assume that every node has complete network information, i.e. it knows how many nodes that exists, if they are insured or not. The link establishment process is bidirectional, meaning both nodes must agree to establish the connection.
Through out this chapter new features will be added to the model to make it more realistic and applicable. 

A set of $n$ nodes are randomly chosen to be insured or not, as depicted in Figure \ref{fig:firstmod1}. They all get their own fixed income, and by connecting to other nodes they can increase their payoff. Non-insured nodes will have a risk of failure i.e. an expected cost of failure. Therefore if an insured agents chooses to connect to a non-insured nodes they will also suffer from this expected cost of failure. To simplify the decision process, the model follows a rule that only allows insured to connect to other insured agents and non-insured agents can only connect with each other. 

The resulting graph will be two fully connected cliques, one consisting of insured agents and the other of non-insured agents, as shown in Figure  \ref{fig:firstmod2}. 


This dichotomy represents a trusted environment for the insured nodes, because they know that each node in the clique is insured against risk. These nodes will benefit from each connection without having to worry about contagious risks from the connected nodes. 
A node in the non-insured clique will also experience a change in payoff from the links it has established, however each of the links has a probability of failure. Hence this environment is not trusted, and a link establishment will always involve some risk. 

Hence this model, although very simple, shows an insurable topology where insured agents benefit from being insured.

\textbf{fjern dette?}
This model is very simplified and suffer from many limitations, among others it is too simple to reflect the dynamics of a real world scenario, where each node will have different variables with different values. Although it tries to deal with the problem of correlated risks and preventing free riders from entering the trusted clique (interdependent security problem), each node have a complete network information i.e. the problem with information asymmetry is not taken into account.

\section{Model 2 - Including Parameters}
To make the simple model more realistic, we have to introduce some parameters, that reflects real world scenarios.
It is fair to assume that the insured nodes must pay an insurance premium, and this premium should be dependent on the number of links the node establishes. When two insured nodes establish a link between each other, they both have to pay a premium, this is to make the game more fair, and more realistic. For example if the two nodes had different insurance companies, then both companies would charge them for insuring the link.
When a node, insured or not, establish a link to a non-insured node, this involves a risk, and this risk will be represented as a expected risk cost. However if the changes in payoff when establishing a link is only negative, then no node would want to establish links. Thus the nodes will also receive a positive change in payoff when establishing different links. 

\subsection{Characteristics of the model}
The type of the nodes are given in advance, i.e. they are chosen to be insured or non-insured. The process of establishing link is a bidirectional decision. 
The insured nodes have to pay an insurance cost $I_{0}$, which represents the cost of signing a contract with an insurance company. I.e this could be an actual fee or a cost reflecting the work a player has to do to get a contract. The insurance premium is $I_{l}$, the expected risk cost is represented by $r$. $\beta$ represents the benefit of establishing a link.  
Table \ref{tbl:simplegamepara} presents an overview of the parameters. 
\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lc}
 \hline
  $\beta$ - income from establishing a direct link \\
  $I_{o}$ - cost of having insurance. \\
  $I_{l}$ - increased insurance cost per link the node establishes\\
  $r$ - expected risk cost\\
  \hline
\end{tabular}
\label{tbl:simplegamepara}
\end{table}
\subsection{Two nodes scenario}
To begin analyzing the model, lets start with a simple scenario involving only two nodes. In this game the strategy space of both players consist of four different strategies. A node can be insured or not, and choose whether to establish a link to the other node or not. I.e. the different strategies are: Be insured and establish link noted as: $IL$, 
be insured and not establish link: $I\overline{L}$. Not insured and establish link: $\overline{I}L$, and not insured and not establish link: $\overline{IL}$. It should be noted that since the decision to establish a connection is bidirectional, both have to choose a strategy where they want to establish a link, for the link establishment to be successful.
Figure \ref{fig:FirstGameTheoryModel} shows the different outcomes of this game.

\begin{sidewaysfigure}

\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{../Figures/FirstGameWithParameters.png}

\end{sidewaysfigure}

As long as both $I_{l} \text{ and } r$ is less than $\beta$, the only nash equilibrium in Figure \ref{fig:FirstGameTheoryModel} is when both nodes chooses $\overline{I}L$. If we first look at node A, we see that when node B chooses $IL$, the best response is $\overline{I}L$, because $ \beta >\beta- I_{l}$ . And since the game is symmetric, the same holds for node B. 
When one of the nodes chooses $\overline{I}L$, the best response will be $\overline{I}L$, because $\beta - r>\beta - I_{l} - r  $. 
And thus the only nash equilibrium is when both nodes play $\overline{I}L$.

This means that two nodes will end up in a classic prisoner's dilemma
\footnote{Prisoner's dilemma was originally framed by Merrill Flood and Melvin Dresher in 1950. The dilemma expresses a situation where two players each have two options whose output depends on the simultaneous choice made by the other. In the original dilemma concerns two prisoners which separately decides whether to confess to a crime \cite{oxfordPrisonersDilemma}. It is a paradox in decision analysis which shows why two individuals might not cooperate, even if it is in their best interest to do so.}
, where the best response is actually worse than the social optimal. In this case it is trivial to see that the social optimal scenario is for both nodes to choose $IL$, as long as $I_{l}<r$. However,  the nodes will choose not to buy insurance. Or else they could risk ending up in a case where they pay $I_{l}$ without receiving any other benefit.

\subsection{Multiple nodes}
\subsubsection{Assumptions}
In this model we introduce multiple nodes, the type of the node is as before given in advance. The objective of this model is to find characteristic network formations that will evolve endogenously when the parameters are within certain conditions. Examples of characteristic networks of interest are cliques, scale-free and star networks.
We assume that every node has complete information of the network, i.e. every node knows the type of the other players. This is a very strong assumption, however in financial transactions and in software development networks, it is reasonable to assume that the parties can acquire this type of information regarding their transactional partners. For example by requiring proof of insurance prior to establishing a financial contract.
\subsubsection{Analyzis}
As mentioned our goal is to find how and when certain network formations evolve. We know that if a node can increase his payoff by establishing a link, he will do so. And thus we start by analyzing the four possible link establishment scenarios, insured to insured, insured to non-insured, non-insured to insured, and non-insured to non-insured. 
Let $U_{i}$ denote the payoff of a node with degree $i$, and let $U_{i+1}$ be the payoff a node will receive if it establishes a new link.
\subparagraph{Insured to insured}
When two insured nodes are considering establishing a link, they will do so, only if both receive a higher payoff.  In this scenario the the payoff function of adding a link is as shown in Eq.(\ref{eq:itoimodel2}).
\begin{equation}
    U_{i+1}= 
\begin{cases}
    \beta - I_{l},& \text{if } i = 0\\
    U_{i}+\beta -I_{l},& \text{if }  i>0
   
\end{cases}
\label{eq:itoimodel2}
\end{equation}
For insured node to connect to another insured node, the condition shown in Eq.(\ref{eq:itoi-condition}) has to hold.
\begin{equation}
I_{l}<\beta
\label{eq:itoi-condition}
\end{equation}
\subparagraph{Non-insured to insured}
The payoff a non-insured receives by connecting to a insured is as described in Eq. (\ref{eq:noti-to-i-model2}). As we see this will allways be a positive change in payoff, and thus an non-insured node will allways, if possible, want to connect to an insured node.
\begin{equation}
    U_{i+1}= 
\begin{cases}
    \beta,& \text{if } i = 0\\
    U_{i}+\beta,& \text{if }  i>0
   
\end{cases}
\label{eq:noti-to-i-model2}
\end{equation}
\subparagraph{Insured connect to non-insured}
The payoff a insured node receives in this scenario is as follows:
\begin{equation}
    U_{i+1}= 
\begin{cases}
    \beta - I_{l}-r,& \text{if } i = 0\\
    U_{i}+\beta -I_{l}-r,& \text{if }  i>0
   
\end{cases}
\label{eq:itonotimodel2}
\end{equation}
For this to happen Eq.(\ref{eq:itonoti-condition}) has to hold, a non-insured node will allways want to connect to a insured one, so this is the only condition that is needed for this to happen.
\begin{equation}
I_{l}+r<\beta
\label{eq:itonoti-condition}
\end{equation}
\subparagraph{Non-insured to Non-insured}
The payoff a non-insured nodes receives when connecting to another non-insured node is as follows:
\begin{equation}
    U_{i+1}= 
\begin{cases}
    \beta -r,& \text{if } i = 0\\
    U_{i}+\beta -r,& \text{if }  i>0
   
\end{cases}
\label{eq:notitonotimodel2}
\end{equation}
And for this link-establishment scenario to happen Eq.(\ref{eq:notitonoti-condition} has to hold.

\begin{equation}
\beta>r
\label{eq:notitonoti-condition}
\end{equation}
We want to find when different network structures evolve, one good starting point for this is a clique of only insured nodes. For this to happen, first of all insured nodes must connect to each other, i.e. Eq.(\ref{eq:itoi-condition}) has to hold. But we also need to ensure that insured nodes do not establish links with non-insured nodes. I.e. this has to hold:
\begin{equation}
I_{l}+r>\beta
\end{equation}
This gives us the limitation shown in Eq. (\ref{eq:final condition}) on insurance link cost.
\begin{equation}
\beta-r<I_{l}<\beta
\label{eq:final condition}
\end{equation}
If the condition is fulfilled the game will end up with a clique of only insured nodes, and another clique of non-insured nodes if: $\beta>r$. 

\subsubsection{Result and findings}

As shown, if the insurance cost is within its needed limitations, the network will evolve endogenously, and end up with an insurable-clustered component, which is beneficial for both the insurer and the nodes.
These findings is independent of number of players, because we only consider one link at a time, and the change in payoffs is linear an independent of the nodes degree.

\end{table}

On the other hand, if $I_{l}>\beta$, then it is easily seen that only the non-insured will connect to each other, and the insured nodes will not choose to connect to anyone because it is to expensive.

\section{Simulating Model 2}
To verify the result of this network formation game with multiple nodes, we performed different simulations. The network formation is performed by selecting two random nodes, not neighbouring each other, then both nodes checks whether they would prefer to establish a connection or not. The rules are as described earlier, when a node is considering establishing a link it chooses to do so if the payoff received is larger than the payoff he already poses, and the decision is bilateral. 
In the simulator a node is insured with a probability, $p$. This selection is repeated until the network are fully connected or no more nodes are willing to establish new connections.
By selecting nodes at random and checking if both of them would like to connect to each other, we relax the assumption of full network information, because now nodes only get to know if another node is insured or not, by asking them.

In Figure \ref{fig:firstsimulation} we see the result of a simulation with the parameters from table \ref{tbl:simplegamevalue}. Since these parameter values holds for the condition Eq.(\ref{eq:final condition}), the game should end up in two cliques, one with insured nodes and another with non-insured. The result are shown in Figure \ref{fig:firstsimulationresult}, and confirms our calculations where only insured nodes connect to each other.  
In this figure there are only included $n=10$ nodes, this is done to make the figure readable and easy to understand.
The same results where obtained when performing the simulation with larger values of n, however the resulting printouts was very complex and chaotic.

In this simulation, the cost of insuring a link where violating the Eq.(\ref{eq:final condition}). The result can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:SimulationViolating}.  In figure \ref{fig:SimulationViolatingA} we see the result when $I_{l}<\beta-r$, the result is one clique of both insured and non-insured nodes. In figure \ref{fig:SimulationViolatingB} the insurance cost is $I_{l}>\beta$, and as we see only non-insured nodes connect to each other, because the insurance cost per link cost more than the benefit given from connecting to a new node, i.e. the insured ones choose not to establish any connections. 
  
....SLETTE DETTE NEDENFOR?!?!  
do this we have to analyze the different scenarios. 
When non-insured nodes connect to each other, they both end up with the payoff shown in Eq. (\ref{eq:notinsured payoff}). If they do not establish connection, they both receive the payoff shown in Eq. (\ref{eq:notinsured payoff2}).
\begin{equation}
U=- 2*r +\beta
\label{eq:notinsured payoff}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
U=- r
\label{eq:notinsured payoff2}
\end{equation}

From this equation we see that if $r>\beta$ then no connections will be made between non-insured nodes, because they would strictly prefer the payoff from not connecting.
If an insured node connects to a non-insured one, he will end up with the payoff in Eq.(\ref{eq:insured-noninsured0}). If he do not connect he will receive the payoff shown in Eq.(\ref{eq:insured-noninsured2}).

\begin{equation}
U= - I_{0} - I_{l} - r + \beta
\label{eq:insured-noninsured0}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
U= - I_{0}
\label{eq:insured-noninsured2}
\end{equation}

If $I_{l}+r>\beta$ the insured one will prefer not to connect, else he would prefer to establish a connection, and since the non-insured agent is always better off when connected to an insured agent, he will accept the establishment. This can be shown when comparing the two payoffs. Payoff of connecting to an insured one: $U_{i}=- r + \beta$ is allways higher than not connecting: $U_{i}= - r$, as long as $\beta>0$.

\section{Model 3 - Including maximum node degree and bonus}
We keep adding new features to the model, here we introduce a maximum node degree per node, and a payoff bonus when reaching this level. This is done to make a more applicable model in certain scenarios. For example, lets consider a software company who want to develop a new product. However, they do not have the required resources or knowledge to complete the product, and will therefore need help from other companies with the desired knowledge or resources. When the product is finished the company get paid, but not before, to finish the product they need to cooperate with others.
To model this scenario we added a bonus $\gamma$, which represents the payoff when a node reach their desired number off established connections, i.e. their maximum node degree($m$). Except from this fact the game is as before, nodes connect to other nodes if they can reach a higher payoff by doing so. 



\subsubsection{Four different scenarios}
To further analyze this model, lets take a closer look on the four different scenarios of the game, a insured node wants to connect to another insured node, insured tries to connect to a non-insured node, non-insured tries to connect to another non-insured node, and non-insured who tries to connect to a insured node.
\subparagraph{Insured to insured}
When an insured node tries to connect to another insured node, the node decision depends on whether he can increase his payoff. 
Let $U_{i}$ denote the payoff of a node with node-degree $i$. When adding a link the payoff the node receives is as follows:
\begin{equation}
    U_{i+1}= 
\begin{cases}
    \alpha + \beta - I_{0} - I_{l},& \text{if } i = 0\\
    U_{i}+\beta -I_{l},& \text{if }  i>0\\
    U_{i}+\beta -I_{l}+\gamma,& \text{if } i=m
    
\end{cases}
\label{eq:itoi}
\end{equation}
For insured nodes to connect to each other, $U_{i+1} > U_{i}$. This model is very similar to the earlier model, but we need to consider the received bonus when reaching the maximum node degree, $m$.
We model this by adding, the bonus divided on the current degree, in the decision process of establishing link or not. 
\begin{eqnarray}
U_{i}+\beta-I_{l}+\frac{\gamma}{m-i}&>U_{i} \nonumber \\ 
\beta-I_{l}+\frac{\gamma}{m-i}&>0 \nonumber \\ 
\llap{$\rightarrow$\hspace{50pt}} \beta+\frac{\gamma}{m-i}&>I_{l} 
\label{eq:itoi2}
\end{eqnarray}
It should be noted that the actual bonus is not added to the current payoff before the node reach the maximum degree, as shown in Eq.(\ref{eq:itoi}). The equation $\frac{\gamma}{ m-i}$ reflects the expected payoff from taking the risk of establishing a connection. This value increases linearly according to how close you are to reach $m$.
In this way the model will change from the former models, because now the nodes have more incentive to connect to other nodes, and in some scenarios they will be willing to take the risk of connecting to a non-insured node in order to reach the expected bonus. The model now introduces a risk factor, because it is not certain that the nodes will obtain enough links, and if not, they will not receive their bonus, however they are stuck with the established connections. 

\subparagraph{Insured connect to non-insured}
The payoff an insured node receives in this scenario is as follows:
\begin{equation}
    U_{i+1}= 
\begin{cases}
    \alpha + \beta - I_{0} - I_{l} -r,& \text{if } i = 0\\
    U_{i}+\beta -I_{l}-r,& \text{if }  i>0\\
    U_{i}+\beta -I_{l}-r+\gamma,& \text{if } i=m
\end{cases}
\label{eq:itonoti}
\end{equation}
To establish a connection from an insured node to a non-insured one, the following has to hold:
\begin{eqnarray}
U_{i}+\beta-I_{l}-r+\frac{\gamma}{m-i}&>U_{i} \nonumber \\ 
\beta-I_{l}-r+\frac{\gamma}{m-i}&>0 \nonumber \\ 
\llap{$\rightarrow$\hspace{50pt}} \beta+\frac{\gamma}{m-i}-r&>I_{l} 
\end{eqnarray}
\subparagraph{Non-insured to non-insured}
When a non-insured node connect to another not-insured node this is the payoff they receive:
\begin{equation}
    U_{i+1}= 
\begin{cases}
    \alpha + \beta -r,& \text{if } i = 0\\
    U_{i}+\beta -r,& \text{if }  i>0\\
    U_{i}+\beta -r +\gamma,& \text{if } i=m
\end{cases}
\label{eq:noitonoti}
\end{equation}
To establish the connection the following equation has to hold:
\begin{eqnarray}
U_{i}+\beta-r+\frac{\gamma}{m-i}&>U_{i} \nonumber \\ 
\beta-r+\frac{\gamma}{m-i}&>0 \nonumber \\ 
\llap{$\rightarrow$\hspace{50pt}} \beta+\frac{\gamma}{m-i}&>r
\end{eqnarray}
\subparagraph{Non-insured to insured}
\begin{equation}
    U_{i+1}= 
\begin{cases}
    \alpha + \beta,& \text{if } i = 0\\
    U_{i}+\beta,& \text{if }  i>0\\
    U_{i}+\beta +\gamma,& \text{if } i=m
\end{cases}
\label{eq:noitoti}
\end{equation}
As we see, this is a strictly increasing function, and thus a non-insured will always connect to an insured node if given the option, and as long as $\beta$ is positive, which it is, given the rules of the model.

\subparagraph{Limitations to ensure a clique of only insured}
We are interested in finding insurable topologies, one candidate is a sub graph consisting of only insured nodes. By analyzing the different scenarios above we can find limitations on the cost of insuring a link, that will force the network formation game to end up in an insurable sub graph.
We know that an insured node would want to connect to another insured node if  Eq.(\ref{eq:itoi2}) is satisfied. 
In the equation we see that the expected bonus per established link is increasing, i.e. if an insured node of degree zero is willing to connect to another insured node, then every node with a degree higher than zero also would like to connect to another insured node. Thus to ensure that insured nodes connect to each other this equation has to hold:
\begin{equation}
\beta+\frac{\gamma}{m}>I_{l}
\label{eq:conditionitoi}
\end{equation}
We also want to ensure that insured nodes never establishes links with non-insured nodes, from \ref{eq:itonoti} we see that this has to hold:
\begin{equation}
\beta+\frac{\gamma}{m-i}-r < I_{l}
\label{eq:conditionitonoti}
\end{equation}
This can be simplified, since we know the insured nodes with degree $m-1$ get the highest expected bonus when establishing a new link, i.e. if we can ensure that nodes with this degree do not establish links to non-insured nodes, we also know that every node with degree less than $m-1$ will not establish links to non-insured nodes. From this we get the equation:
\begin{eqnarray}
\beta+\frac{\gamma}{m-(m-1)}-r&<I_{l} \nonumber\\
\llap{$\rightarrow$\hspace{50pt}} \beta+\gamma-r&<I_{l}
\label{eq:condition-i-to-noti}
\end{eqnarray}
To summarize, Eq.(\ref{eq:conditionitoi}) and Eq.(\ref{eq:conditionitonoti}) gives the final limitation on the link insurance cost:
\begin{equation}
\beta+\gamma-r<I_{l}<\beta+\frac{\gamma}{m}
\label{eq:final-insurance-clique-condition}
\end{equation}
Additionally, in order to make it possible for the game to end up in an insurable topology Eq.(\ref{eq:noinsuredcliqueconditon}) has to be satisfied. As we see from the equation, if the risk to bonus ratio gets to small it gets more and more unlikely to ensure an insurable topology. If we think about a real world scenario where you get a bonus for establishing a fixed number of equations, you would be more willing to take a risk if the possible reward of doing so is large, this is what this equation express. 
\begin{eqnarray}
\gamma-r &<\frac{\gamma}{m}\nonumber \\
1-\frac{r}{\gamma}&<\frac{1}{m} \nonumber \\
\llap{$\rightarrow$\hspace{50pt}}1-\frac{1}{m}&<\frac{r}{\gamma}
\label{eq:noinsuredcliqueconditon}
\end{eqnarray}

\subsection{Simulations}
We simulate how networks form when the conditions from Eq.(\ref{eq:final-insurance-clique-condition}) are met, and what happens when they are not. In addition we use the simulation to look at the consequences with regards to the payoff, when the required number of connections aren't met. 

\subparagraph{Simulation when conditions are met}
First we simulate a network formation game when the link insurance cost satisfied the Eq.(\ref{eq:final-insurance-clique-condition}), using the parameters in table \ref{tbl:maxdegrevalues}. 
\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lc}
 \hline
  $\alpha=10,
  \beta=10,
  I_{o}=5,
  I_{l}=9,
  r=8,
  \gamma=5,
  m=5
  $
  \\
  \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Parameters used in the simulation \label{tbl:maxdegrevalues}}
\end{table}
\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{../Figures/BonusGameInsuredClique.png}
  \caption{\label{fig:bonusoptimal} Two clustered fully connected networks, created by simulating with the parameters from table \ref{tbl:maxdegrevalues} One consisting of insured agents the other consists of non-insured. }
\end{figure}
As we see in Figure \ref{fig:bonusoptimal} the results where as expected, the cost of insuring a link satisfied the conditions found earlier and thus the result where two cliques, one consisting of only insured and the other of non-insured nodes.

\subparagraph{Simulation when the parameters violates the conditions}
If we change the link insurance cost, so it is just below the limit, $I_{l}=6$, the result is quite different as depicted in Figure \ref{fig:bonusviolating}. Here we see that eventhough non-insured nodes can fail and accumulate negative payoff, some of the insured nodes have taken a risk by connecting to non-insured nodes in order to receive the bonus. 

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{../Figures/BonusGameViolating.png}
  \caption{\label{fig:bonusviolating} Simulation when the cost of insuring a link is just below the limits. }
\end{figure}


\subparagraph{Consequences of not reaching required number of edges}
Both of these scenarios ends up in a situation where the nodes reach their maximum node degree and they all receive the bonus. However each time a node chooses to connect to another node, except when $i=m-1$, it does not know whether it will reach the maximum node degree. Hence the node might take a risk of connecting to other nodes without being able to reach their required number of connections. This means that in certain situation one might end up getting a total $i<m$ connections which results in a much lower payoff than expected. If the variables are set close to a worst-case, such as in table \ref{tbl:maxdegrevalueswitherror} , we end up with two cliques with payoffs close too or worse than the payoff each node had initially. 

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lc}
 \hline
  $\alpha=10,
  \beta=10,
  I_{o}=5,
  I_{l}=11,
  r=8,
  \gamma=25,
  m=11
  $
  \\
  \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Parameters used in simulation \label{tbl:maxdegrevalueswitherror}}
\end{table}

  \caption{\label{fig:payoffMaxDegreeSimulation} The different payoffs received when fulfilling and violating the conditions given in \ref{eq:final-insurance-clique-condition}, using the parameters from table \ref{tbl:maxdegrevalues} and \ref{tbl:maxdegrevalueswitherror}. }
\end{figure}

As depicted in Figure \ref{fig:payoffMaxDegreeSimulation}, with the variables from table \ref{tbl:maxdegrevalueswitherror} the resulting payoffs from Figure \ref{fig:bonusviolatingWithErrors} equals $6$ for each of the non-insured nodes and $-1$ for the insured nodes. In comparison, the same figure using the variables from table \ref{tbl:maxdegrevalues} results in a positive payoff $15$ for each of the nodes in the insured clique. This comparison shows the consequences of failing to achieve the required amount of connections, which might be the case if a company is trying to complete a project which requires too many external suppliers.

\section{Model 4 - Including bulk insurance discount}

Insurance companies often interpret a quantum discount when purchasing multiple products. From convenience stores we are used to the slogan "buy one get one for free". It seems to be common for insurance companies to offer discount to their customers if they choose to collect some or all of their insurances with them. Several insurance companies in Norway, such as Sparebank 1 offers customers up to 25 $\%$ discount according to the following rules \cite{sparebank1}. 

\begin{itemize}

\item 10$\%$ discount if the person has signed three different insurances
\item 15$\%$ discount if the person has signed four different insurances
\item 20$\%$ discount if the person has signed five or more different insurances
\item Plus additional 5$\%$ discount if the person is a customer of the bank. 

\end{itemize}

The insurance offered is intended to the individual market and includes among others: travel insurance, household insurance, car insurance, house insurance, insurance of valuable items and yacht insurance. Since this seems to be the trend for marketing insurance products, it is reasonable to believe that several bonus options would be included in a cyber-insurance product. Since our model so far reflects that a company have to insure each of the connections to other nodes in their network, it is assumed that a similar discount rate following the number of established would be implemented. 

How insurance companies choose to formulate their discount rate might vary. One solution might be to follow a strict 5$\%$ discount per new connection, similar to the one from Sparebank 1, or let the discount follow a power law. However, we choose to follow a discount rule which directly reflects the number of connections the company have established. 
The price for adding a new connection follows the equation:

\begin{equation}
\frac{I_{l}}{i+1}
\label{eq:discount0}
\end{equation}

Here, $i$ is the current number of established connections. This means that the more connections a company acquire the cheaper the connections will be. 
If we add the new rule to the Eq.(\ref{eq:itoi}) which shows the connection between two insured nodes, we get the following equations: 

\begin{equation}
    U_{i+1}= 
\begin{cases}
    \alpha + \beta - I_{0} - I_{l},& \text{if } i = 0\\
    U_{i}+\beta -\frac{I_{l}}{i+1},& \text{if }  i>0\\
    U_{i}+\beta -\frac{I_{l}}{i+1}+\gamma,& \text{if } i=m
    
\end{cases}
\label{eq:discount1}
\end{equation}

As described, for insured nodes to connect to each other, $U_{i+1} > U_{i}$. Building on the already existing model, the quantum discount slightly changes the decision process:
\begin{eqnarray}
U_{i}+\beta-\frac{I_{l}}{i+1}+\frac{\gamma}{m-i}&>U_{i} \nonumber \\ 
\beta-\frac{I_{l}}{i+1}+\frac{\gamma}{m-i}&>0 \nonumber \\ 
\beta (i+1)+\frac{\gamma}{m-i}&>\frac{I_{l}}{i+1} \nonumber \\
\llap{$\rightarrow$\hspace{50pt}}  \beta (i+1)+\frac{\gamma (i+1)}{m-i}&>I_{l}
\label{eq:discount2}
\end{eqnarray}

Similar calculation can be done for the other three scenarios in the game, and they all result in almost the same outcome. First of all results from having quantum discounts on new connections results in a overall higher payoff for the nodes, as long as $i>1$. Since the cost of insuring a new link becomes cheaper. This means that the nodes will have a higher incentive to create links to each other, because the left side of Eq.(\ref{eq:discount2}) yields a higher payoff than before. Which leads to a consequence that more insured nodes could connect to non-insured nodes. 
Building on the final condition \ref{eq:final-insurance-clique-condition} in previous section, we now get:

\begin{eqnarray}
\beta+\gamma-r<\frac{I_{l}}{i+1}<\beta+\frac{\gamma}{m} \nonumber \\
\beta(i+1)+\gamma(i+1)-r(i+1)<I_{l}<\beta(i+1)+\frac{\gamma(i+1)}{m}
\label{eq:final-insurance-clique-condition-with-discount}
\end{eqnarray}


From Eq.(\ref{eq:final-insurance-clique-condition-with-discount}) we see that the initial variable $I_(l)$ has to be priced higher, in order to ensure that only insured nodes connects to other insured nodes. However, beside this drawback, we also experience some positive effects from the modification, since the the purchase of more connections is cheaper the product might be more attractive for potential customers.

\section{DETTE ET ANNET STED KANSKJE? BLIR LITT RART √Ö HOPPE INN I DET HER}
By adjusting the parameter one can assure that only insured agents connects to other insured agents, and the opposite,
that only uninsured agents connects to each other. Hence as we can see from the Figure \ref{fig:fincont} clustered
networks of insured agents (red) are created, and  as the paper \cite{contagion} showed, these clustered trusted
networks, can achieve higher, super-critical, payoff by increasing their node degree past the critical point.

, because the nodes can thus receive a super-critical payoff, and they are also insured against contagious risk.  

Figure \ref{fig:GTmodel1equations} presents the individual payoffs in a formation game between two agents in the described model. It is assumed that both agents has to have a desire to establish a connection in order to create a link between them. This is reasonable since a company would not prefer to enter into an agreement with negative expected payoff. As in this case would be the result when an insured agent is requested a connection with someone without insurance.

\end{figure}
\footnotetext{A link will only be created if both agents wishes to establish a connection.}

If we give value to the variables in Figure \ref{fig:GTmodel1equations} one can observe the model's different equilibrium's. It is difficult to know exactly how the variables are set and this would vary considerably between different markets. In a real worlds scenario the variables would also be different for each agent. However in Figure \ref{fig:GTmodel1} we decided to set a fixed value (which is assumed to be corresponding to the real values) for each variable in order to show a concept of how cyber-insurance can be used to create beneficial payoffs.
The following values where used: $\alpha$ = 10, $\beta$ = 10, $I_{o}$ = 5, $I_{l}$ = 2, $r$  = 20, $q$ = 0.5.

\end{tabular}
\caption{\label{fig:GTmodel1} Shows equilibrium's in the resulting payoff matrix.}
\end{figure}

From the payoff matrix \ref{fig:GTmodel1} we observe two different Nash equilibrium's: One when both agents are insured and wants to connect to the other agent, and one when both are insured but does not want to establish a connection. These are the possible outcomes between the two agents, however as we can see it the social optimal solution would be for two insured agents to connect with each other, i.e they would both receive a significantly higher payoff. This demonstrates that a cluster of insured nodes would achieve higher payoffs.
