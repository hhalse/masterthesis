\chapter{Modeling Cyber-Insurance }
\label{chp:modelingCyberInsurance} 

In many scenarios nodes seeks to create networks in order to directly benefit from each other. The established links might represent companies out sourcing part of their manufacturing, or cooperative agreements in the development of new software products. In addition to increase the trade-off, each of the established links represents risk of being a victim of cascading failures. The intuitive example is the spread of epidemic diseases, also node failures of a power grid and financial contagion such as the one back in 2008 was a result of cascading failures. Strategic network formation using cyber-insurance can be used to prevent such situation in addition to increase the overall payoff of participants in a clustered network.


When deciding whether to establish connection to a neighbor agent, the payoff has to be higher in the balance between the expected earnings and the risk of the other party failing to complete the transaction. This is the reason why we seek to only download content from trusted peers and outlaw MC-gangs are consistently skeptical to enter into new agreements despite promising increased earnings, since the risk of undercover police are too high. 

Inspired by the model in paper \cite{contagion} [SKRIV OM SÃ… DET PASSER... DEN ER BESKREVET I RELATED WORK], we are step wise building a model which shields light on how cyber-insurance can be used in network formation games to prevent cascading failures and increase an agents payoff.

\end{figure}
There are many examples of nodes needing to establish connections, one example is a company needing to out-source certain tasks to remain competitive. This outsourcing involves some risks, such as, will the company deliver at the reported time, to the reported costs, what happens if they fail to deliver, what if they go bankrupt etc. If the companies that are going to establish links(cooperative contracts), know that the other firms are insured, it will be more secure and reliable to enter into an cooperative agreement. In this way trusted cliques can evolve. The firms benefit from connecting to other insured firms, and the insurance company can offer fair prices to the insured companies, because the risk is calculable in a trusted clique.

As a starting point the model is highly simplified in order to show the concept of how cyber-insurance can be used to create an insurable topology. We assume that every node has complete network information, i.e. it knows how many nodes that exists, if they are insured or not. The link establishment process is bidirectional, meaning both nodes must agree to establish the connection.
Through out this chapter new features will be added to the model to make it more realistic and applicable, an overview of the different models can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:Overview-of-models}.

A set of $n$ nodes are randomly chosen to be insured or not, as depicted in Figure \ref{fig:firstmod1}. They all get their own fixed income, and by connecting to other nodes they can increase their payoff. Non-insured nodes will have a risk of failure i.e. an expected cost of failure. Therefore if an insured agents chooses to connect to a non-insured nodes they will also suffer from this expected cost of failure. To simplify the decision process, the model follows a rule that only allows insured to connect to other insured agents and non-insured agents can only connect with each other. 

The resulting graph will be two fully connected cliques, one consisting of insured agents and the other of non-insured agents, as shown in Figure  \ref{fig:firstmod2}. 


This dichotomy represents a trusted environment for the insured nodes, because they know that each node in the clique is insured against risk. These nodes will benefit from each connection without having to worry about contagious risks from the connected nodes. 
A node in the non-insured clique will also experience a change in payoff from the links it has established, however each of the links has a probability of failure. Hence this environment is not trusted, and a link establishment will always involve some risk. 

Hence this model, although very simple, shows an insurable topology where insured agents benefit from being insured.

This model is very simplified and suffer from many limitations, among others it is too simple to reflect the dynamics of a real world scenario, where each node will have different variables with different values. Although it tries to deal with the problem of correlated risks and preventing free riders from entering the trusted clique (interdependent security problem), each node have a complete network information i.e. the problem with information asymmetry is not taken into account.

\section{Model 2 - Including Parameters}
To make the simple model more realistic, we have to introduce some parameters, that reflects real world scenarios.
It is fair to assume that the insured nodes must pay an insurance premium, and this premium should be dependent on the number of links the node establishes. When two insured nodes establish a link between each other, they both have to pay a premium, this is to make the game more fair, and more realistic. For example if the two nodes had different insurance companies, then both companies would charge them for insuring the link.
When a node, insured or not, establish a link to a non-insured node, this involves a risk, and this risk will be represented as a expected risk cost. However if the changes in payoff when establishing a link is only negative, then no node would want to establish links. Thus the nodes will also receive a positive change in payoff when establishing different links. 

\subsection{Characteristics of the model}
The type of the nodes are given in advance, i.e. they are chosen to be insured or non-insured. The process of establishing link is a bidirectional decision. 
The insured nodes have to pay an insurance cost $I_{0}$, which represents the cost of signing a contract with an insurance company. I.e this could be an actual fee or a cost reflecting the work a player has to do to get a contract. The insurance premium is $I_{l}$, the expected risk cost is represented by $r$. $\beta$ represents the benefit of establishing a link.  
Table \ref{tbl:simplegamepara} presents an overview of the parameters. 
\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lc}
 \hline
  $\beta$ - income from establishing a direct link \\
  $I_{o}$ - cost of having insurance. \\
  $I_{l}$ - increased insurance cost per link the node establishes\\
  $r$ - expected risk cost\\
  \hline
\end{tabular}
\label{tbl:simplegamepara}
\end{table}
\subsection{Two nodes scenario}
To begin analyzing the model, lets start with a simple scenario involving only two nodes. In this game the strategy space of both players consist of four different strategies. A node can be insured or not, and choose whether to establish a link to the other node or not. I.e. the different strategies are: Be insured and establish link noted as: $IL$, 
be insured and not establish link: $I\overline{L}$. Not insured and establish link: $\overline{I}L$, and not insured and not establish link: $\overline{IL}$. It should be noted that since the decision to establish a connection is bidirectional, both have to choose a strategy where they want to establish a link, for the link establishment to be successful.
Figure \ref{fig:FirstGameTheoryModel} shows the different outcomes of this game.

\begin{sidewaysfigure}

\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{../Figures/FirstGameWithParameters.png}
\caption{\label{fig:FirstGameTheoryModel} Normal form game, showing the different strategies and the payoffs  for the different outcomes. The payoff are written in this order, A then B's. An agent has a strategy space of size 4. Maa ENDRES, FIKS NAVN IKKE FIRM, MEN NODE}
\end{sidewaysfigure}

As long as both $I_{l} \text{ and } r$ is less than $\beta$, the only nash equilibrium in Figure \ref{fig:FirstGameTheoryModel} is when both nodes chooses $\overline{I}L$. If we first look at node A, we see that when node B chooses $IL$, the best response is $\overline{I}L$, because $ \beta >\beta- I_{l}$ . And since the game is symmetric, the same holds for node B. 
When one of the nodes chooses $\overline{I}L$, the best response will be $\overline{I}L$, because $\beta - r>\beta - I_{l} - r  $. 
And thus the only nash equilibrium is when both nodes play $\overline{I}L$.

This means that two nodes will end up in a classic prisoner's dilemma
\footnote{Prisoner's dilemma was originally framed by Merrill Flood and Melvin Dresher in 1950. The dilemma expresses a situation where two players each have two options whose output depends on the simultaneous choice made by the other. In the original dilemma concerns two prisoners which separately decides whether to confess to a crime \cite{oxfordPrisonersDilemma}. It is a paradox in decision analysis which shows why two individuals might not cooperate, even if it is in their best interest to do so.}
, where the best response is actually worse than the social optimal. In this case it is trivial to see that the social optimal scenario is for both nodes to choose $IL$, as long as $I_{l}<r$. However,  the nodes will choose not to buy insurance. Or else they could risk ending up in a case where they pay $I_{l}$ without receiving any other benefit.

\subsection{Multiple nodes}
\subsubsection{Assumptions}
In this model we introduce multiple nodes, the type of the node is as before given in advance. The objective of this model is to find characteristic network formations that will evolve endogenously when the parameters are within certain conditions. Examples of characteristic networks of interest are cliques, scale-free and star networks.
We assume that every node has complete information of the network, i.e. every node knows the type of the other players. This is a very strong assumption, however in financial transactions and in software development networks, it is reasonable to assume that the parties can acquire this type of information regarding their transactional partners. For example by requiring proof of insurance prior to establishing a financial contract.
\subsubsection{Analyzis}
As mentioned our goal is to find how and when certain network formations evolve. We know that if a node can increase his payoff by establishing a link, he will do so. And thus we start by analyzing the four possible link establishment scenarios, insured to insured, insured to non-insured, non-insured to insured, and non-insured to non-insured. 
Let $U_{i}$ denote the payoff of a node with degree $i$, and let $U_{i+1}$ be the payoff a node will receive if it establishes a new link.
\subparagraph{Insured to insured}
When two insured nodes are considering establishing a link, they will do so, only if both receive a higher payoff.  In this scenario the the payoff function of adding a link is as shown in Eq.(\ref{eq:itoimodel2}).
\begin{equation}
    U_{i+1}= 
\begin{cases}
    \beta - I_{l},& \text{if } i = 0\\
    U_{i}+\beta -I_{l},& \text{if }  i>0
   
\end{cases}
\label{eq:itoimodel2}
\end{equation}
For insured node to connect to another insured node, the condition shown in Eq.(\ref{eq:itoi-condition}) has to hold.
\begin{equation}
I_{l}<\beta
\label{eq:itoi-condition}
\end{equation}
\subparagraph{Non-insured to insured}
The payoff a non-insured receives by connecting to a insured is as described in Eq. (\ref{eq:noti-to-i-model2}). As we see this will allways be a positive change in payoff, and thus an non-insured node will allways, if possible, want to connect to an insured node.
\begin{equation}
    U_{i+1}= 
\begin{cases}
    \beta,& \text{if } i = 0\\
    U_{i}+\beta,& \text{if }  i>0
   
\end{cases}
\label{eq:noti-to-i-model2}
\end{equation}
\subparagraph{Insured connect to non-insured}
The payoff a insured node receives in this scenario is as follows:
\begin{equation}
    U_{i+1}= 
\begin{cases}
    \beta - I_{l}-r,& \text{if } i = 0\\
    U_{i}+\beta -I_{l}-r,& \text{if }  i>0
   
\end{cases}
\label{eq:itonotimodel2}
\end{equation}
For this to happen Eq.(\ref{eq:itonoti-condition}) has to hold, a non-insured node will allways want to connect to a insured one, so this is the only condition that is needed for this to happen.
\begin{equation}
I_{l}+r<\beta
\label{eq:itonoti-condition}
\end{equation}
\subparagraph{Non-insured to Non-insured}
The payoff a non-insured nodes receives when connecting to another non-insured node is as follows:
\begin{equation}
    U_{i+1}= 
\begin{cases}
    \beta -r,& \text{if } i = 0\\
    U_{i}+\beta -r,& \text{if }  i>0
   
\end{cases}
\label{eq:notitonotimodel2}
\end{equation}
And for this link-establishment scenario to happen Eq.(\ref{eq:notitonoti-condition} has to hold.

\begin{equation}
\beta>r
\label{eq:notitonoti-condition}
\end{equation}
We want to find the conditions for when different network structures will evolve, for example a clique of only insured nodes. For this to happen, all insured nodes must connect to each other, i.e. Eq.(\ref{eq:itoi-condition}) has to hold. But we also need to ensure that insured nodes do not establish links with non-insured nodes. I.e. this has to hold:
\begin{equation}
I_{l}+r>\beta
\end{equation}
This gives us the limitation shown in Eq. (\ref{eq:final condition}) on the insurance link cost.
\begin{equation}
\beta-r<I_{l}<\beta
\label{eq:final condition}
\end{equation}
As we see from the condition, if the link insurance cost is between the two boundaries all insured nodes will connect with each other, and no other nodes. If the link insurance cost is greater than $\beta$, then no insured node will establish any links. And if it is below $\beta-r$, then the insured nodes will also connect to the non-insured ones.
It should also be noticed that as long as $r<\beta$, then the non-insured nodes will connect to each other. 

\subsection{Result and findings}
From the analyzis we found different conditions on the link establishment process. If Eq. (\ref{eq:final condition}) is fulfilled, then the network will end up with one clique of only insured nodes. The non-insured nodes will end up in another clique if the risk of connecting to another non-insured node is less than the benefit of establishing link( $r<\beta$).
If the link insurance cost and risk of connecting to non-insured nodes is less than the benefit($I_{l}+r<\beta$), then insured nodes will also connect to non-insured nodes. And the network will end up in one giant clique.

These findings is independent of number of players, because we only consider one link at a time, and the change in payoffs is linear an independent of the nodes degree.
\subparagraph{Stability versus efficiency}
When measuring stability in this model, it is easily seen that since the change in payoff when adding links is linear, and non-dependent on the nodes degree, the resulting network will be pairwise-stable. It also follows from the defintion of a nash equilibrium, that the resulting network is a equilibrium, since every player have best responded to the other players best responses, and no node can increase its payoff by single handedly changing a strategy. 
To calculate the efficiency we need to sum up the overall payoff, and compare it with the maximum possible payoff.  The total payoff can be calculated as in Eq. (\ref{eq:model2-total-payoff-general}), where $\sum I \times I$ represents the sum of payoffs achieved from links between insured nodes. $\sum I \times \overline{I}$ the sum of payoffs achieved from links between non-insured and insured, and $\sum \overline{I} \times \overline{I}$, the sum of payfoss achieved from links between non-insured and non-insured nodes. 
\begin{equation}
U_{total}=\sum I \times I+\sum \overline{I}\times\overline{I}+\sum I\times\overline{I}
\label{eq:model2-total-payoff-general}
\end{equation}
When the parameters are inserted in Eq. (\ref{eq:model2-total-payoff-general}), we get the Eq. (\ref{eq:}), where $N_{I} \text{ and } N_{\overline{I}}$, represents the number of insured and non-insured nodes in the network.
\begin{equation}
U_{total}=N_{I}(N_{I}-1)(\beta-I_{l})+N_{\overline{I}}(N_{\overline{I}}-1)(\beta-r)+N_{I}N_{\overline{I}}(2\beta-r-I_{l})
\label{eq:model2-total-payoff}
\end{equation}
If we calculate the overall payoff for a network with one-clique of insured and another with non-insured, i.e. Eq. (\ref{eq:final condition}) has to hold and $r<\beta$. The total payoff is as shown in Eq. (\ref{eq:model2-two-cliques-payoff}).
\begin{equation}
U_{total}=N_{I}(N_{I}-1)(\beta-I_{l})+N_{\overline{I}}(N_{\overline{I}}-1)(\beta-r)
\label{eq:model2-two-cliques-payoff}
\end{equation}
However, this is not the socially best outcome, because in this scenario, $2\beta>r+I_{l}$, will always be true. Thus the socially best outcome would have been one clique, with both insured and non-insured nodes. The price of stability is shown in Eq. (\ref{eq:model2-pos}).
\begin{equation}
PoS=\frac{N_{I}(N_{I}-1)(\beta-I_{l})+N_{\overline{I}}(N_{\overline{I}}-1)(\beta-r)}{N_{I}(N_{I}-1)(\beta-I_{l})+N_{\overline{I}}(N_{\overline{I}}-1)(\beta-r)+N_{I}N_{\overline{I}}(2\beta-r-I_{l})}
\label{eq:model2-pos}
\end{equation}
From this we see that the only scenario where the insurer are able to seperate the two types of nodes, and have an efficient and stable outcome, is when there are only links between insured, or between non-insured, or no links at all.
This can only happen when $2\beta<I_{l}+r$, and $I_{l}>\beta+\beta-r$ or $r>\beta+\beta-I_{l}$ or if both $I_{l} \text{and }r$ is larger than $\beta$.

\subsubsection{Simulation of the results}
To verify the result of this network formation game with multiple nodes, we performed different simulations. The network formation is performed by selecting two random nodes, not neighbouring each other, then both nodes checks whether they would prefer to establish a connection or not. 
The rules are as described earlier, when a node is considering establishing a link it chooses to do so if the payoff received is larger than the payoff he already poses, and the decision is bilateral.
In the simulator a node is insured with a probability, $p$. This selection is repeated until the network are fully connected or no more nodes are willing to establish new connections.
By selecting nodes at random and checking if both of them would like to connect to each other, we relax the assumption of full network information, because now nodes only get to know if another node is insured or not, by asking them.

\end{figure}
In Figure \ref{fig:firstsimulation} we see the result of a simulation with the parameters: $\beta=0.9$, $I_{l}=r=0.5$. With these parameters the Eq.(\ref{eq:final condition}) holds, and $r<\beta$, thus the network formation game ends up in two cliques, one with insured nodes and another with non-insured. The result are shown in Figure \ref{fig:firstsimulation:b}, and confirms our calculations.
In this figure there are only included $n=10$ nodes, this is done to make the figure readable and easy to understand.
The same results where obtained when performing the simulation with larger values of n, however the resulting printouts was very complex and chaotic.

In the next simulations, the parameters where chosen to violate the Eq.(\ref{eq:final condition}). The result can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:SimulationViolating}.  In figure \ref{fig:SimulationViolating:a} we see the result when $I_{l}<\beta-r$, the result is one clique of both insured and non-insured nodes. In figure \ref{fig:SimulationViolating:b} the insurance cost is $I_{l}>\beta$, and as we see only non-insured nodes connect to each other, because the insurance cost per link cost more than the benefit given from connecting to a new node, i.e. the insured ones choose not to establish any connections.

\section{Model 3 - Including maximum node degree and bonus}
In real world networks, such as in software development, consultant firms and many other types of business, a goal can not be completed without outsourcing some of the task needed for reaching the goal. This could be because the firm lack knowledge, the task can only be performed by specialists etc. Thus the firm that outsource tasks are dependent on the other firms, and will not reach their goal before the other firms deliver their contribution. 
For example, lets consider a software company who want to develop a new product. However, they do not have the required resources or knowledge to complete the product, and will therefore need help from other companies with the desired knowledge or resources. When the product is finished the company get paid, but not before, to finish the product they need to cooperate with others.
This process of outsourcing introduces a risk of failure due to other parties. To model this scenario we introduce a maximum node degree per node, and a a bonus $\gamma$, which represents the payoff when a node reach their desired number off established connections, i.e. their maximum node degree($m$).
Except from this the game is as before.
\subsection{Analyzis}
This model is very similar to the earlier model, for nodes to connect to each other, the change in payoff has to be positive: $U_{i+1} > U_{i}$. However, we also need to consider the bonus received when reaching the maximum node degree, $m$. 
To model this we add, the possible bonus divided on the number of links required to reach the bonus($\frac{\gamma}{m-i}$), every time a node is considering a link establishment. 
In this way the model will change from the former models, because now the nodes have more incentive to connect to other nodes, and for every step closer to the goal, the nodes are more willing to accept risk than before. For example, an insured node is more likely to accept a risky link when it only need one more link to reach the goal. Compared to when it needs many more links to reach the goal.

 The model now introduces a risk factor, because it is not certain that the nodes will obtain enough links, and if not, they will not receive their bonus, and they are stuck with the already established connections. 

To analyze this model, lets take a closer look on the four different scenarios of the game.
\subparagraph{Insured to insured}
When establishing a link between two insured nodes, the payoff the nodes will receive is as described in Eq. (\ref{eq:itoi}).
\begin{equation}
    U_{i+1}= 
\begin{cases}
    \alpha + \beta - I_{0} - I_{l},& \text{if } i = 0\\
    U_{i}+\beta -I_{l},& \text{if }  i>0\\
    U_{i}+\beta -I_{l}+\gamma,& \text{if } i=m
    
\end{cases}
\label{eq:itoi}
\end{equation}
As described earlier we need to include the possibility of reaching the goal in the decision, and thus for insured nodes to connect to each other, Eq. (\ref{eq:itoi2}) has to hold.
\begin{eqnarray}
U_{i}+\beta-I_{l}+\frac{\gamma}{m-i}&>U_{i} \nonumber \\ 
\beta-I_{l}+\frac{\gamma}{m-i}&>0 \nonumber \\ 
\llap{$\rightarrow$\hspace{50pt}} \beta+\frac{\gamma}{m-i}&>I_{l} 
\label{eq:itoi2}
\end{eqnarray}


\subparagraph{Insured connect to non-insured}
The payoff an insured node receives in this scenario is as follows:
\begin{equation}
    U_{i+1}= 
\begin{cases}
    \alpha + \beta - I_{0} - I_{l} -r,& \text{if } i = 0\\
    U_{i}+\beta -I_{l}-r,& \text{if }  i>0\\
    U_{i}+\beta -I_{l}-r+\gamma,& \text{if } i=m
\end{cases}
\label{eq:itonoti}
\end{equation}
To establish a connection from an insured node to a non-insured one, the following has to hold:
\begin{eqnarray}
U_{i}+\beta-I_{l}-r+\frac{\gamma}{m-i}&>U_{i} \nonumber \\ 
\beta-I_{l}-r+\frac{\gamma}{m-i}&>0 \nonumber \\ 
\llap{$\rightarrow$\hspace{50pt}} \beta+\frac{\gamma}{m-i}-r&>I_{l} 
\end{eqnarray}
\subparagraph{Non-insured to non-insured}
When a non-insured node connect to another not-insured node this is the payoff they receive:
\begin{equation}
    U_{i+1}= 
\begin{cases}
    \alpha + \beta -r,& \text{if } i = 0\\
    U_{i}+\beta -r,& \text{if }  i>0\\
    U_{i}+\beta -r +\gamma,& \text{if } i=m
\end{cases}
\label{eq:noitonoti}
\end{equation}
To establish the connection the following equation has to hold:
\begin{eqnarray}
U_{i}+\beta-r+\frac{\gamma}{m-i}&>U_{i} \nonumber \\ 
\beta-r+\frac{\gamma}{m-i}&>0 \nonumber \\ 
\llap{$\rightarrow$\hspace{50pt}} \beta+\frac{\gamma}{m-i}&>r
\end{eqnarray}
\subparagraph{Non-insured to insured}
\begin{equation}
    U_{i+1}= 
\begin{cases}
    \alpha + \beta,& \text{if } i = 0\\
    U_{i}+\beta,& \text{if }  i>0\\
    U_{i}+\beta +\gamma,& \text{if } i=m
\end{cases}
\label{eq:noitoti}
\end{equation}
As we see, this is a strictly increasing function, and thus a non-insured will always connect to an insured node if possible.
\subsection{Result and findings}

If we want an clique of only insured nodes, we have to ensure that insured nodes connect to each other, and that they do not establishes connections to non-insured nodes.
We know that an insured node would want to connect to another insured node if  Eq.(\ref{eq:itoi2}) is satisfied. 
In the equation we see that the expected bonus per established link is increasing, i.e. if an insured node of degree zero is willing to connect to another insured node, then every node with a degree higher than zero also would like to connect to another insured node. Thus to ensure that insured nodes connect to each other this equation has to hold:
\begin{equation}
\beta+\frac{\gamma}{m}>I_{l}
\label{eq:conditionitoi}
\end{equation}
We also want to ensure that insured nodes never establishes links with non-insured nodes, from \ref{eq:itonoti} we see that this has to hold:
\begin{equation}
\beta+\frac{\gamma}{m-i}-r < I_{l}
\label{eq:conditionitonoti}
\end{equation}
This can be simplified, if can ensure that the least risk averse insured node, i.e. the node with degree $m-1$, do not establish links with non-insured nodes. Then we know that no insured node with degree less than $m-1$ will establish link with non-insured nodes. From this we get the equation Eq. (\ref{eq:condition-i-to-noti}).
\begin{eqnarray}
\beta+\frac{\gamma}{m-(m-1)}-r&<I_{l} \nonumber\\
\llap{$\rightarrow$\hspace{50pt}} \beta+\gamma-r&<I_{l}
\label{eq:condition-i-to-noti}
\end{eqnarray}
To summarize, Eq.(\ref{eq:conditionitoi}) and Eq.(\ref{eq:condition-i-to-noti}) gives the final limitation on the link insurance cost, Eq. (\ref{eq:final-insurance-clique-condition}). If this equation is satisfied the resulting network will contain a clique of only insured nodes.
\begin{equation}
\beta+\gamma-r<I_{l}<\beta+\frac{\gamma}{m}
\label{eq:final-insurance-clique-condition}
\end{equation}
For this to even be possible $\beta+\gamma-r<\beta+\frac{\gamma}{m}$, i.e. Eq. (\ref{eq:noinsuredcliqueconditon}) has to hold. This equation reflects that as the risk to bonus ratio gets smaller, it gets more and more unlikely to ensure a clique of only insured nodes. And when the risk to bonus ratio is less than $1-\frac{1}{m}$, such a clique will never occur. If we think about a real world scenario where you get a bonus for establishing a fixed number of equations, you would be more willing to take a risk if the possible reward of doing so is large, this is what this equation express.
It is also useful to know when non-insured nodes connect to each other, this happens when Eq. (\ref{eq:noitonoti}) is satisfied. This equation is dependent on the node degree, and thus for the first link to be established from a non-insured node the expected payoff has to be higher than the risk( $\beta+\frac{gamma}{m}>r$). If the risk is to high, then the non-insured node must wait for one or more insured node who are willing to establish links with non-insured nodes.
With these findings, an insurer can easily determine the outcome of the network formation game, by adjusting the
insurance cost parameter. If he want a clique of only insured nodes Eq. (\ref{eq:final-insurance-clique-condition}) has to
hold. However, it is easy to relax the condition, such that a insured node only connect to, $j=1,2,3..m$ nodes,
   this is done by changing Eq. (\ref{eq:condition-i-to-noti}) to $\beta+\frac{\gamma}{m-(m-j)}-r<I_{l}$, which
    gives us Eq. (\ref{eq:lower-boundary-link-insurance-cost}).
An interesting result in this model is that due to the risk willingness among the nodes, the lower boundary on the link insurance cost has increased compared to the one in model 2. 

\subparagraph{Consequences of not reaching required number of edges}
When a node establishes a link, it does not know whether it will reach the maximum node degree. Hence the node might end up not reaching the desired goal. This can happen if there is not enough nodes willing to establish links. If the bonus to risk ratio is very high, or nodes need lots of links, then this is a likely scenario. And nodes who do not reach their goal can end up with a payoff less than $U_{0}$. 

\begin{equation} 
\beta+\frac{\gamma}{j}-r<I_{l}
\label{eq:lower-boundary-link-insurance-cost}
\end{equation} 
\begin{eqnarray}
\gamma-r &<\frac{\gamma}{m}\nonumber \\
1-\frac{r}{\gamma}&<\frac{1}{m} \nonumber \\
\llap{$\rightarrow$\hspace{50pt}}1-\frac{1}{m}&<\frac{r}{\gamma}
\label{eq:noinsuredcliqueconditon}
\end{eqnarray}
\subparagraph{Efficiency and Stability( SKRIVE NOE OM DETTE, selvom det er vanskelig Ã¥ analysere}
In this model, the incentive for establishing links has been increased. And thus to maintain a stable network with two cliques, the cost of link establishment has to be increased, compared to model 2. This increased incentive may result in a higher price of stability. 
\subsubsection{Simulation of the results}
In our first simulation we have set the variables such that Eq.(\ref{eq:final-insurance-clique-condition}) are satisfied. The parameters are set to the following: $\beta=0.9, I_{l}=0.7, r=0.5, \gamma=0.2 \text{ and }m=5$.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{../Figures/BonusGameInsuredClique.png}
  \caption{\label{fig:bonusoptimal} Two cliques, one consisting of insured agents the other consists of non-insured. All nodes have reached their goal. }
\end{figure}
As we see in Figure \ref{fig:bonusoptimal} the results where as expected, the cost of insuring a link satisfied the conditions found earlier and thus the result where two cliques, one consisting of only insured and the other of non-insured nodes.
An interesting thing to notice is that $\beta$ and $r$ is the same as in model 2, but to ensure that only insured connect to each other, the link insurance cost needs to be higher. This is to compensate for the risk the nodes now are willing to take. 

If we change the link insurance cost to the same value as in model 2, $I_{l}=0.5$, the result is  as depicted in Figure \ref{fig:bonusviolating}. Here we see that allmost every insured node has taken the risk of connecting to a non-insured node in order to achieve their goal. By inserting the numbers in to Eq. (\ref{eq:lower-boundary-link-insurance-cost}) we see that the insured nodes are willing to connect to up to two non-insured nodes to reach their goal.

\section{Model 4 - Including bulk insurance discount}
\textbf{Putte det som starter her i background?}
Insurance companies often interpret a quantum discount when purchasing multiple products. From convenience stores we are used to the slogan "buy one get one for free". It seems to be common for insurance companies to offer discount to their customers if they choose to collect some or all of their insurances with them. Several insurance companies in Norway, such as Sparebank 1 offers customers up to 25 $\%$ discount according to the following rules \cite{sparebank1}. 

\begin{itemize}

\item 10$\%$ discount if the person has signed three different insurances
\item 15$\%$ discount if the person has signed four different insurances
\item 20$\%$ discount if the person has signed five or more different insurances
\item Plus additional 5$\%$ discount if the person is a customer of the bank. 

\end{itemize}

The insurance offered is intended to the individual market and includes among others: travel insurance, household insurance, car insurance, house insurance, insurance of valuable items and yacht insurance.
\textbf{til hit!!}

So far our model reflects that a company have to insure each of the links to other nodes, inspired by other insurance products, we would like to introduce a discount rate following the degree of the nodes. This will make it more attractive for nodes with high degree to acquire insurance, and this could act as a incentive for other nodes to also acquire insurance. Thus this seems like a good model to include.  

How insurance companies choose to formulate their discount rate might vary. One solution might be to follow a strict 5$\%$ discount per new connection, similar to the one from Sparebank 1(REFERER TIL CHAPTER BACKGROUND), or let the discount follow a power law. However, we choose to follow a discount rule which directly reflects the number of links the node has established. 
\subsection{Analyzis}
The price for adding a new link follows the equation:
\begin{equation}
\frac{I_{l}}{i+1}
\label{eq:discount0}
\end{equation}
Here, $i$ is the current number of established connections. This means that the more connections a node acquire the cheaper the links will be. 
\subsubsection{Discount model}
We start our analyzis by considering a model where only the discount are included, not the bonus, and as before we analyze the four different connection scenarios. However, it is only the scenario where insured connects to other insured nodes and insured to non-insured nodes, that has changed compared to model 2.
\subparagraph{Insured to insured}
When we add the discount to the conditions found in model 2 we find the condition shown in Eq. (\ref{eq:model4-discount-i-to-i}).
\begin{equation}
\frac{I_{l}}{i+1}<\beta
\label{eq:model4-discount-i-to-i}
\end{equation}
\subparagraph{Insured to non-insured}
For this scenario to be possible Eq. (\ref{eq:model4-discount-i-to-noti}) has to hold.
\begin{equation}
\frac{I_{l}}{i+1}+r<\beta
\label{eq:model4-discount-i-to-noti}
\end{equation}
\subparagraph{Result and findings}
For a insurer to be able to ensure that the network ends up in a clique with only insured nodes, we must ensure that the most expensive link establishment, i.e. the first, to another insured node can be achieved. This gives us the same condition as in model 2, i.e. $I_{l}<\beta$. 
We also need to ensure that insured does not connect to non-insured, thus we get the final condition in Eq. (\ref{eq:model4-discount-condition-only-insured}), where $N_{I}$ is the number of insured nodes in the network.
\begin{equation}
(N_{I}-1)(\beta-r)<I_{l}<\beta
\label{eq:model4-discount-condition-only-insured}
\end{equation}
This is condition is very strong, because it says that $\beta-r<\frac{1}{N_{I}-1}$, and as the number of insured nodes gets higher this get more and more unlikely. 
Thus by including bulk-discount, the insurer are making it harder for himself to constrain the network formation. This is because the incentive for establishing links are higher than without discount, and thus more links will be established.
\subparagraph{Price of Stability versus efficiency}
If we compare the total payoff equation in this model, see Eq. (\ref{eq:model4-discount-total-payoff}), with the one in model 2(Eq. (\ref{eq:model2-total-payoff})). We see that what has changed is the cost for insured nodes, and thus the payoff generated from links between insured nodes has increased, and so have the payoff received from links between insured and non-insured nodes. 
As we know, in a scenario where the insurer sets the cost, such that the network will end up in two cliques, the payoff received from links between insured and non-insured are zero. This potential payoff, in a scenario where there are two cliques, can be described like this: $(N_{I}N_{\overline{I}}\beta+N_{I}(-\sum_{i=N_{I}}^{N_{\overline{I}}-1}\frac{I_{l}}{i}))$, and as long as $(N_{I}N_{\overline{I}}\beta>N_{I}(-\sum_{i=N_{I}}^{N_{\overline{I}}-1}\frac{I_{l}}{i}))$ it would have been socially optimal to have one-clique of both insured and non-insured nodes.
When the cost of establishing links decreases and the insurer forces the network formation to end up in two cliques, the price of stability will increase compared to the price of stability in model 2. 
This is because the incentive for establishing links has increased, and thus for the insurer to be able to constrain the network formation, the cost of establishing links has to be higher.

%{eq:model2-total-payoff-general}
\begin{equation}
U_{total}=(N_{I}(N_{I}-1)\beta-N_{I} \sum_{i=1}^{N_{I}-1} \frac{I_{l}}{i})+(N_{\overline{I}}(N_{\overline{I}}-1)(\beta-r))+(N_{I}N_{\overline{I}}\beta+N_{I}(-\sum_{i=N_{I}}^{N_{\overline{I}}-1}\frac{I_{l}}{i}))
\label{eq:model4-discount-total-payoff}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Discount and Bonus model}
We also need to apply the discount to the model where the bonus is included, and we start out as before we analyze the four different connection scenarios. However, it is only the scenario where insured connects to other insured nodes and insured to non-insured nodes, that has changed.
\subparagraph{Insured to insured}

If we add the new rule to the Eq.(\ref{eq:itoi}) which shows the connection between two insured nodes, we get the following equations: 

\begin{equation}
    U_{i+1}= 
\begin{cases}
    \beta - I_{l},& \text{if } i = 0\\
    U_{i}+\beta -\frac{I_{l}}{i+1},& \text{if }  i>0\\
    U_{i}+\beta -\frac{I_{l}}{i+1}+\gamma,& \text{if } i=m
\end{cases}
\label{eq:discount1}
\end{equation}
For insured to connect to each other Eq. (\ref{eq:model4-bonus-i-to-i}) has to hold.

\begin{eqnarray}
U_{i}+\beta-\frac{I_{l}}{i+1}+\frac{\gamma}{m-i}&>U_{i} \nonumber \\ 
\beta-\frac{I_{l}}{i+1}+\frac{\gamma}{m-i}&>0 \nonumber \\ 
\llap{$\rightarrow$\hspace{50pt}}\beta +\frac{\gamma}{m-i}&>\frac{I_{l}}{i+1}
\label{eq:model4-bonus-i-to-i}
\end{eqnarray}

\subparagraph{insured to non-insured}
When insured are considering connecting to non-insured, they payoff they will receive are shown in Eq. (\ref{eq:model4-bonus-i-to-ni}).
\begin{equation}
U_{i+1}= 
\begin{cases}
    \beta - I_{l}-r,& \text{if } i = 0\\
    U_{i}+\beta -\frac{I_{l}}{i+1}-r,& \text{if }  i>0\\
    U_{i}+\beta -\frac{I_{l}}{i+1}-r+\gamma,& \text{if } i=m
\end{cases}
\label{eq:model4-bonus-i-to-ni}
\end{equation}
For this scenario to be able to happen Eq. (\ref{eq:model4-bonus-i-to-ni-final}) has to hold.
\begin{eqnarray}
U_{i}+\beta-\frac{I_{l}}{i+1}+\frac{\gamma}{m-i}-r&>U_{i} \nonumber \\ 
\llap{$\rightarrow$\hspace{50pt}}\beta+\frac{\gamma}{m-i}&>r+\frac{I_{l}}{i+1}
\label{eq:model4-bonus-i-to-ni-final}
\end{eqnarray}
\subsection{Result and findings}
If we analyze the same scenario as in the other models, a clique of only insured nodes. The first step is to ensure that insured nodes connect to each other when the expected payoff is lowest, i.e. at node degree zero. If they are willing to establish link at this point, then they will also be willing at all degrees higher than zero.
At degree zero there is no discount on the insurance link cost, and thus if Eq. (\ref{eq:eq:conditionitoi}) from model 3 holds, insured nodes will connect to other insured nodes.

But the condition for ensuring that insured do not connect to non-insured has changed, we know if an insured node do not want to establish a link with a non-insured at degree $m-1$, then no insured node with degree lower than $m-1$ will do so either. From this we find the condition, see Eq. (\ref{eq:model4-bonus-i-not-ni})
\begin{eqnarray}
U_{i}+\beta-\frac{I_{l}}{m}+\frac{\gamma}{m-(m-1)}-r&<U_{i} \nonumber \\ 
\beta+\gamma-r&<\frac{I_{l}}{m}\nonumber \\ 
\llap{$\rightarrow$\hspace{50pt}}m(\beta +\gamma-r)&<I_{l}\nonumber
\label{eq:model4-bonus-i-not-ni}
\end{eqnarray}
This is a very strong condition, because the only way this can happen is if $\beta+\gamma-r<\frac{1}{m}$.  This shows us that when the incentives for establishing links increases, it gets more and more difficult for the insurer to ensure a clique of only insured nodes. 
The final condition for ensuring a clique of only insured nodes is shown in Eq. (\ref{eq:model4-final-condition-insured-clique}).

\begin{equation}
m(\beta +\gamma-r)<I_{l}<\beta+\frac{\gamma}{m}
\label{eq:model4-final-condition-insured-clique}
\end{equation}

Similar calculation can be done for the other three scenarios in the game, and they all show the same. The quantum discount results in a overall higher payoff for the nodes, since the cost of insuring a new link becomes cheaper. This means that the nodes will have a higher incentive to create links to each other. Which makes it harder for the insurer to seperate insured and non-insured nodes.

\section{DETTE ET ANNET STED KANSKJE? BLIR LITT RART Ã… HOPPE INN I DET HER}
By adjusting the parameter one can assure that only insured agents connects to other insured agents, and the opposite,
that only uninsured agents connects to each other. Hence as we can see from the Figure \ref{fig:fincont} clustered
networks of insured agents (red) are created, and  as the paper \cite{contagion} showed, these clustered trusted
networks, can achieve higher, super-critical, payoff by increasing their node degree past the critical point.

, because the nodes can thus receive a super-critical payoff, and they are also insured against contagious risk.  

Figure \ref{fig:GTmodel1equations} presents the individual payoffs in a formation game between two agents in the described model. It is assumed that both agents has to have a desire to establish a connection in order to create a link between them. This is reasonable since a company would not prefer to enter into an agreement with negative expected payoff. As in this case would be the result when an insured agent is requested a connection with someone without insurance.

\footnotetext{A link will only be created if both agents wishes to establish a connection.}

If we give value to the variables in Figure \ref{fig:GTmodel1equations} one can observe the model's different equilibrium's. It is difficult to know exactly how the variables are set and this would vary considerably between different markets. In a real worlds scenario the variables would also be different for each agent. However in Figure \ref{fig:GTmodel1} we decided to set a fixed value (which is assumed to be corresponding to the real values) for each variable in order to show a concept of how cyber-insurance can be used to create beneficial payoffs.
The following values where used: $\alpha$ = 10, $\beta$ = 10, $I_{o}$ = 5, $I_{l}$ = 2, $r$  = 20, $q$ = 0.5.

\end{figure}

From the payoff matrix \ref{fig:GTmodel1} we observe two different Nash equilibrium's: One when both agents are insured and wants to connect to the other agent, and one when both are insured but does not want to establish a connection. These are the possible outcomes between the two agents, however as we can see it the social optimal solution would be for two insured agents to connect with each other, i.e they would both receive a significantly higher payoff. This demonstrates that a cluster of insured nodes would achieve higher payoffs.
