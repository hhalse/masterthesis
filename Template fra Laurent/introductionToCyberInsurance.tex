\section{Motivation}
Security breaches are increasingly prevalent in the Internet age causing huge financial losses for companies and their users. Cyber-insurance is a powerful economic concept that can help companies in the fight against such malicious behavior. Earlier research suggests that cyber-insurance has failed to reach its promising potential, although the concept of cyber-insurance has been around since the 1980s. 

The researchers claims that a functional model for cyber-insurance has to handle the problems regarding interdependent security, correlated-risk and asymmetrical-information. Many researchers have proposed models to solve these problems, but the market still strives to succeed. Another problem with cyber-insurance is to determine the overall risk in the network. If cyber-insurance networks were describable and analyzable by graphs, the calculation of overall risk would be much easier. Does it exists network-structures that are superior as cyber-insurance networks compared to other networks? If so, is it possible for insurers determine the structure of these networks, or even better create new or transform existing networks into a certain structure?

\section{Problem definition}
In this project, the goal is to analyze the current state of the cyber-insurance market. Study and characterize network structures suited to be used as a cyber-insurance network. -A desired structure will possesses some characteristics that would be beneficial to reflect a cyber-insurance network. And to build a model, which can relate to different real world scenarios, using network formation to force the creation of these structures. 
\section{Readers guide}
In chapter 1 we give an brief introduction to cyber-insurance and a study of the current market for cyber-insurance. In chapter 2, we discuss and summarize other related papers regarding cyber-insurance. In chapter 3 we discuss different graphs and their properties, these graphs is the foundation for the models we create in chapter 5. Chapter 4 explains the methodology we have used throughout our thesis. In chapter 6 we summarize all our findings, with focus on our models from chapter 5. 

\section{Introduction}
Security breaches are increasingly prevalent in the Internet age causing huge financial losses
for companies and their users. When facing a security breaches and risk, there are typically four ways to handle it \cite{bolot2008new}:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Avoid the risk
\item Retain the risk
\item Self protect and mitigate the risk
\item Transfer the risk
\end{enumerate}
The ICT-industry have so far tried to prevent the risk with a mixture of option two and three. This has lead to many different techniques and software trying to detect threats and anomalies, to protect the users and infrastructure. Such as: firewalls, intrusion- detection and prevention systems. These will reduce the risk, but do not eliminate the risk completely. It is impossible to achieve perfect cyber-security, due to many reasons: Threats are continuously evolving, there will all ways be accidents and security flaws, attackers have different intentions, network externalities and free-riding in security networks, the lemons-market in security products, misaligned incentive between users and product vendors, and many more. 
This is why we need cyber-insurance, as an fourth option, to handle the residual risk \cite{lelarge2009economic,paldifferentiating}.

Cyber-insurance is an insurance product used to transfer financial risk, associated with computer and network related incidents, over to a third party. This third party willingly accept the transfer, in exchange for a fee, called insurance premium.
The insurance could provide coverage against property loss and theft, data damage, cyber-extortion, loss of income due to denial of service attacks or computer failures, reduced reputation and customers churning due to leaked user information and so on. Traditional coverage policies rarely cover incidents like these, therefore the cyber-insurance market have a huge potential \cite{washingtonpaper}.

Although the concept of cyber-insurance has been around since the 1980s, it has failed to reach its promising potential. There might be several reasons for this slow development, however, it is believed that the main reason so far, is that no model deals with all the unique problems of cyber-insurance at once. In addition to the known difficulties of insurance, such as calculating risk, cyber-insurance differs from traditional insurance because it has to deal with the problem of asymmetric information, correlated risk and interdependent security \cite{networkgames}.  

\subparagraph{Traditional Insurance.} 
The basic structure of cyber-insurance relates to traditional insurance, where an insurance contract (policy) binds the insurance company to pay a specified amount to the insurance holder whenever an incidents occur. In return, the insurance holder has to pay a fixed monthly or annually fee (premium) to the insurance company \cite{robinson2012incentives}. The contract includes a risk assessment of the company's vulnerability and clearly specifies the entitled amount of coverage for each of the different risks. These assessments are used to calculate the companies premium \cite{robinson2012incentives}. Generally, this means that the security is negatively correlated with the premium costs. In cyber-insurance this means that better security the lower price on the insurance premium.
   
Generally, to ensure that their business is economically viable, the insurance company will require that an insurable risks possess seven distinct characteristics \cite{mehr1980principles}: 
   \begin{enumerate}
   \item Large number of similar exposure units: Insurance is based on the principle of pooling resources, where insurance policies are offered to individual members of a large class. Meaning the more customers, the closer the predicted losses will get to the actual losses.
   \item Definite loss: A loss should take place at a known time, in a known place and from a known
    cause. Incidents such as a fire or car crash, are examples where these terms are easy to verify.
   \item Accidental loss: The event that triggers a claim should not be 
   something the insurer has discretion or control over.
   \item Large loss: The size of the loss must be meaningful from the perspective of the insured.
    Insurance premiums need to cover both the expected cost of the loss, in addition, 
    cover all the expenses regarding issuing and administrating policies, adjusting losses and
     supplying the capital needed to be able to pay claims.
   \item Affordable premium: The premium must be proportional to the security offered, otherwise no
    one will offer/buy the insurance. In the situation where the likelihood of the insured event is
     high, and the cost is large, it is unlikely that the insurance company will offer the insurance,
      or at least the premium would be too high for anyone to consider buying it. 
   \item Calculable loss: Both the probability and the cost of an insurable event,
    has to atleast be possible to estimate. 
   \item Limited risk of catastrophically large losses: If losses happen all at once the likelihood of
    the insurance company getting bankrupt is high. Therefore, losses are ideally independent and non-catastrophic. 
   \end{enumerate}
   
This model will also apply to the risks covered by cyber-insurance. Unfortunately there are additional obstacles regarding cyber-insurance. The three major problems with cyber-insurance are related to; information asymmetry, interdependent security and correlated risk. 
 
\subparagraph{Information asymmetry.}
Information asymmetry arises when one side in a transaction or a decision has more or better information than the other party. There are two different cases of information asymmetry. The first one is called adverse selection, where one party simply has less information regarding the performance of the transaction. A good example is when buying health insurance, if a person with bad health purchases insurance, and the information about her health is not available to the insurer, we have a classical adverse selection scenario. We can observe a similar situation for the cyber-industry, where an insurer has no way of confirming whether your network is "healthy", i.e. not contaminated, or if it is infected. 
The other information asymmetry scenario is called moral hazard. It occurs after the signing of the contract, if one party deliberately takes some action that makes the possibility of loss higher, i.e. choosing not to lock your door, since you have insurance. Or in the computer setting, deliberately visiting hostile web-pages, or not using anti-virus software, firewalls or other self-protection software \cite{solutiontoinfoasym}.
    
    
As we see, the information asymmetry problem is highly relevant regarding cyber-insurance. Measuring the level of security is very hard, and in order to lower the premiums people will have an incentive for hiding information about their security level. Another problem occurs on the customer side of the market. For a customer wanting to improve their defence mechanisms, the software security market often becomes a lemons market 
\footnote{Lemon market, the problem of quality uncertainty, was first introduced in a paper \cite{lemonpaper} by the economist George Akerlof in 1970,and used the market for used cars as an example.\cite{lemon} The conclusion of the paper is that since the buyers lack information to distinguish a bad car(lemon) from a good one(cherry), the buyer will not pay the price the seller wants for a cherry, and the seller will not sell a cherry for the price of a lemon, and thus the lemons drives the cherries out of the market.}
. 
It is difficult for the buyer to distinguish the performance of different software products, and thus the reasonable thing to do, is to buy the cheapest. Thus, the good security products has to charge the same price as the bad. If the cost of producing good security software is too high, the problem can even result in abandoning the production of good software, because it would not be profitable.

      
\subparagraph{Correlated risk.}

Another big concern regarding cyber-insurance, is the correlated risk. Among others, the problem occurs due to the need of standards. Standardization is an important part of computers and computer networks. Generally it enables computers to communicate, install and use different software. A good example is operative systems for personal computers, today we only have a small set of operative systems available, and these systems are standardized, so they can communicate over the same communication channels. The standards generates a lot of the value in the ICT-industry, but it also makes large extents of threats possible. All systems that uses the same standards, creates a large number of similar exposure units, they share common vulnerabilities, which could be exploited at the same time. As we see this violates the insurance characteristic of limited risk of catastrophically large losses.  
This creates a significant difficulty for the cyber-insurance industry, because when a security breach occurs there is a high probability that it will occur to a large number of people, i.e. catastrophic and extreme events occur with a higher probability than in the regular insurance business. To compensate, the logical thing to do would be to raise the premium cost, however this could violate the characteristics of affordable premiums and large losses. 
If the security breach is large, it could even potentially cause so much damage, that the insurers will not be able to pay all of the customers who suffered, and they could go bankrupt.\cite{bohme2010modeling}


\subparagraph{Interdependent security.}
Another problem in the ICT-industry is interdependent security. Meaning that you are not only dependent on your own investment in security, but also everyone else's. 
Investment in security generates positive externalities, and as public goods, this encourages to free riding. Why should I pay for security when I can just free ride on security invested by others? The problem is that the reward for a user investing in self-protection depends on the security in the rest of the network. i.e. The expected loss due to a security breach at one node, is not only dependent on this nodes level of investment in security, but also on the security investment done by adjacent nodes, and theirs adjacent nodes and so forth. A good example of this is the amount of spam sent every day, which is dependent on the number of compromised computers. Meaning if you have invested in security software of some kind, you still receive lots of spam because there are a variety of people who have not invested
 \cite{towardsInsurable}.
 
\subparagraph{Calculating losses} A problem in several areas of insurance is the calculation of risk. In cyber-insurance, the obstacles above contributes to make this particularly difficult. When facing a security breach there are two potential loss classes:\cite{bandyopadhyay2009managers,mehr1980principles} 
\begin{itemize}
\item primary losses or first-degree losses: direct loss of information or data and operating loss. 
These arises from disuse, abuse or misuse of information.
 The cost of these arise from recovering, loss of revenue, 
 PR and information sharing costs, hiring of IT-specialists etc.
 \item Secondary losses are indirectly triggered. These are the loss of reputation, goodwill, 
consumer confidence, competitive strength, credit rating and customer churning. 
\end{itemize}
The value of the loss from both these classes can be difficult to determine, although the second one is probably the most difficult. Because it is challenging to put a value on i.e. how many potential customers did they loose due to the reputation loss, how many customers churned, and what was their value etc.
It could also be difficult to determine when the loss happened, where and what caused it.
Another problem when calculating losses and determining insurance premiums, is the unavailablity of large amounts of historic data on cyber-crimes, which is needed in many insurance models to calculate the risk, losses and premiums. This problem is further complicated, because many firms do not reveal details about their experienced security breaches. \cite{herath2007cyber}

\subparagraph{Cyber-insurance instead of security.}
Another problem with cyber-insurance is actors seeing it as a solution to the problem of being secure. Instead of investing in security, they now have a way of buying their way out. 
However, as the paper \cite{bolot2008cyber} shows, this problem might be solved with the right pricing options. Meaning that the insurance companies can create pricing models which makes it economical beneficial to invest in security and cyber-insurance. Cyber-insurance could also be used as an incentive for buying security. Such model will also make sense for the insurance company, since better security systems yields lower probability for incidents.

As we see there are many problems regarding cyber-insurance, but the insurance industry have been dealing with many difficult problems in other areas of life. Cyber-insurance faces many challenges, but we cant say that internet risks and damages can not be insured. We just need to find a way of helping the insurers to create a better product. I.e. The challenge is to find a way for the insurers to handle these special characteristics, in order to create a healthy cyber-insurance market. \cite{lelarge2009economic}
