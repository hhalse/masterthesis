\chapter{Introduction to Cyber Insurance}
\label{chp:introductionToCyberInsurance} 

Cyber-insurance is an insurance product used to transfer financial risk
associated with computer and network related incidents over to a third party.
 Coverages provided by cyber-insurance policies may include property loss and
  theft, data damage, cyber-extortion, loss of income due to denial of

   service attacks or computer failures. \cite{washingtonPaper}

  
    Cyber-insurance works the same way as traditional insurance, where the insurance contract (policy) binds the insurance company to pay a specified amount to the insurance holder when certain incidents occurs. In return, the insurance holder has to pay a fixed sum (premium) to the insurance company. \cite{enisarapport}

  Traditional coverage policies rarely cover these incidents, therefore 
   cyber-insurance is seen as a huge potential market. However, the concept 
   of cyber-insurance has been around since the 1980s, but so far it has failed to reach its promising potential.

One problem with cyber insurance is actors see it as a solution to the problem of being secure. Instead of investing in security, they now have a way of buying 
their way out. However, this problem might solve it self due to the fact that insurance companies only will indemnify the losses where victim can prove that a certain event has occurred. When it comes to cyber insurance, one often need computer forensics to generate the evidence needed.
