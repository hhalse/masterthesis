\chapter{Network Games}
\label{chp:networkgames} 

In the paper \cite{contagion}, they come up with some interesting results regarding network formation games. 
They set up a game where the nodes benefit from direct links, but these links also expose them for risk. 
Each node gains a payoff of  $a$ per link it establishes, but it can establish a maximum of $\delta$ links.
A failure occur at a node with probability $q$, and propagates on a link with probability $p$. If a nodes fail, it will receive a negative payoff of $b$, no matter how many links it has established.

The results from their model shows a situation where clustered graphs achieve a higher payoff when connected to trusted agents, compared to when connecting with random nodes. Unlike in anonymous graphs, where nodes connect to each other at random, nodes in these graphs share some information with their neighbours, which is used when deciding whether to form a link or not. 
To further explain these results, they show that there exists a critical point, called phase transition, which occurs when nodes have a node degree of $1/p$. 
At this point a node gets a payoff of $a/p$, to further increase the payoff the node needs to go into a region with significantly higher failure probability. 
Because once each node establish more than $1/p$ links, the edges which propagates risk, will with high probability form a large cluster. Which results in a rise in probability of node failure, and reduces the overall wellfare.
From this the paper say that when the minimum welfare exceeds 
$(1+f(\delta)*a/p)
$
we have reached super critical payoff. Otherwise it is called sub-critical payoff. 
Further they show that the only possible way of ending up with supercritical payoff, is by forming clustered networks consisting of cliques with slightly more than $1/p$ nodes. 
If the nodes form an anonymous market, random linking, they can only get sub-critical payoff. 
In other words, if the nodes can choose who they connect with, and by doing so, creating trusted clustered markets, they can achieve a higher payoff, by exceeding the critical node degree point. But in random graphs, this is not possible.
