\subsection{Cost of cyber crime}
Despite the widespread awareness of cyber crimes, cyber attacks occur frequently. The companies studied in \cite{ccost} experienced successfull every week. A successfull cyber attack can result in serious financial consequences. And the longer it takes to resolve the attack, the more costly it get. This paper found that the median cost of cyber crime is \$5.9 million per year, ranging from \$1.5 million to \$36.5 millon per company, which is an 56 percent increase from the last year.
