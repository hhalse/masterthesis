\section{Survey of models of network formation: stability and efficiency}

There is lots of economic situation where network structure plays an important role. 
It is very important to have information on how these structures form and matter.
We can divide networks into two kinds, the ones where one central agent structures the whole network,
 such as airline network, or networks who are formed out of many different individuals decisions.
 This survey is about the second case, network connect a number of individuals.\cite{jackson2005survey}
 Three questions to focus on:
 \begin{itemize}
 \item How are such network relationships important in determining the outcome of economic interaction?
 \item How can we predict which networks are likely to form when individuals have the discretion to choose their connections?
 \item How efficient are the networks that form and how does that depend on the way that the value of a network is allocated among the individuals?
 \end{itemize}
\subsection{Defining Network Games}
\subparagraph{Players}
$N={1,....n} $ set of players or individuals(organizations, firms, people, etc), modeled as nodes.
\subparagraph{networks}
May take many forms, non-directed, directed networks.
A network $g$ is a list of which pairs of players are linked to each other. 
$N(g)$ is the set of players who have at least one link in the network g.
\subparagraph{Paths and components}
Components of a network are the distinct connected subgraphs of a network, components of g are denoted $C(g)$. 
\subparagraph{Value functions}
\subparagraph{Network games}
\subparagraph{Allocation rules}
to know how much the total value of the network, we need to know how the value is allocated or distributed among players.
