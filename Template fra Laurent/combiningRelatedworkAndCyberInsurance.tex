\chapter{Combining cyber-insurance and network formation}

All the other models to this...
We will try a new approach...
Combine knowledge of graphs, and network formation. We will investigate whether it is possible for the insurer to control the formation of the cyber-insurance network. So that we end up with a star or clique. Our approach will focus endogendous formation by controlling the cost parameters for the insurer. Hence if the insurance premium is high, no one will buy it. On the other hand, if it is free, everyone would benefit from having one, and clique formations will emerge. We are interested in finding the intersections, where both the insurer and their customers will benefit from cyber-insurances.
