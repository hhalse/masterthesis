\section{Cyber-Insurance}
\input{relatedworkFinal}

The paper \cite{bolot2008cyber}, presents how risk management on the internet only have involved methods to reduce the risks, such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, anti virus etc. But none of these have managed to remove the risk completely. In general there are four possible ways of removing risk: avoid it, retain it, self protect and mitigate it or transfer the risk. Most entities on the internet have chosen a mix of of retaining and mitigate by self protecting. 

Unfortunately, these solutions does not eliminate risk completely, and threats evolve over time. Thus, the only option for completely removing the risk, is to transfer it to a party who willingly accepts it, in exchange for a fee. The key-result of this paper is that they show that cyber-insurance will result in overall higher payoff. Because when the premiums discriminates users based on the investment in self protection, it will act as an strong incentive to acquire self protection. 

The paper \cite{danezis2006network} describes an interesting network formation games. Although the paper tries to observe susceptibility to sybil attacks in peer-to-peer networks, their approach on network formation can be related to our thesis. In their game nodes are either friends or strangers, and the goal of the nodes is to selfishly try to fulfill their communication needs. Their needs is to communicate with as many as possible of their friends. This can be achieved by either direct or indirect connections. Every node has a link budget, i.e. a maximum number of links they can establish, and a set of friends they want to connect to. 
They proposes two random games where nodes might have to take the risk of connecting to non-insured nodes.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Random model: Every node in the network initiate a set for friendships with other nodes, denoted $F$. All nodes have the same link budget $L<F$. 
\item Unbalanced Random Mode. The same friendship graph as in the random model is created. However one of the nodes have a significantly larger link budget $(L_{0} > 2 F)$
\end{enumerate}
The first model does not result in any equilibrium, except the one where friends only connect to other friends.
The other model shows some new insights, when the link budget is comparable with their number of friends, most still choose to only connect to friends. However, when the link budget is set to only one link, except for the rich node. Then the resulting equilibrium is a star topology. 

\subsection{Summary}
There are many different papers that have described the problems of cyber-insurance, and proposed different models and solutions. However, as we revealed, the cyber-insurance market is yet far from established and still has lots of potential. Each of the presented models have a slightly different angel towards improving the cyber-insurance market. Although, promising results from the papers, no improvements have appeared in the market-state, and it seems like another approach is needed. -This is what we intend to do. In brief we will investigate whether there are any advantageous structures and use network formation to force nodes to end up in these structures, and stay there.

\subparagraph{NOTES ... Til summary}
As we can see from other related work, each and everyone of them are creating a model trying to solve the cyber-insurance market. Each model have a slightly different angel towards the problem, some of them tries to solve it and even make cyber-insurance better. As we have seen from the current market state, the cyber-insurance market is far from healthy. There are some promising numbers from the US. However, we believe that this market is built on fear from a having to pay high fees due the notification laws. 


We want to take a step back and first determine if there are any network structures which would be preferred as a cyber-insurance market. What we are looking for is a structure that are stable and increases the utility for both the nodes and the insurer. More precisely we want to find a structure which minimizes the cost of h....

The next step will be to use network formation to find out how we from the insurers point of view can force nodes to end up in the preferred structure, and stay there (i.e. for a stable network).
