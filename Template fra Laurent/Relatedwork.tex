\section{Cyber-insurance}
\input{relatedworkFinal}


High correlation in failures in information systems is a huge concern to the cyber-insurance market. The paper \cite{bohme2006models} introduces a new classification of correlation properties. The authors divide it into two levels, the first level is the correlation within firms, and the second level addresses the global correlations. Further, they create an economic model for risk arrival at these two levels, and use it in simulations to find where a market for cyber-insurance can exist or not. BÃ¶hme, et.al. results show that cyber-insurance is best suited for risk-classes where internal correlation is high, and the global correlation is low. This could be one of the reasons for the failure of cyber-insurance so far, the insurers have focused on the wrong markets, i.e. the markets with high global correlation and low internal correlation. One problem with \cite{bohme2006models} is that they do not cover interdependent security neither discuss the problem of information asymmetry.  

The papers \cite{bolot2008cyber, bolot2008new} present how risk management on the internet have only introduced methods to reduce the risks, such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, anti virus etc. But none of these have managed to remove the risk completely. As mentioned in chapter 1, there are four possible ways of removing risk: avoid it, retain it, self-protect and mitigate it or transfer the risk. Most entities on the internet have chosen a mix of of retaining and mitigate by self-protecting. These solutions do not eliminate risk completely, and threats evolve over time. Thus, the only option for completely removing the risk, is to transfer it to a party who willingly accepts it, in exchange for a fee. 
The key result of these papers is that they show economic reasons for users to not invest in self-protection, and that cyber-insurance will act as an incentive for users to acquire self-protection, i.e. the level of security in the internet will increase with cyber-insurance. The reason for this positive spiral is that investment in insurance will result in overall higher payoff, and since the premiums discriminate users based on the investment in self protection, it will act as a strong incentive to acquire self-protection. 

In contrast to the papers \cite{bolot2008cyber, bolot2008new}, the paper \cite{shetty2010competitive} claims that in a competitive cyber-insurance market the users' utility will improve, but the network security will worsen relative to a market without cyber-insurance. By competitive insurers Shetty et.al, mean that there are several insurance contracts to choose from, and user choose the one that increases their utility the most.
\cite{shetty2010competitive} create and explains two models, in the first one the insurers suffer from information asymmetry regarding the users' investment in security. For most of the parameters used, there will not be offered any insurance in an equilibrium, due to the moral hazard problem. In the second model, the insurer is able to observe the users' security investment, and can thus contract discriminate bad and good users, i.e. no moral hazard is present. In this model the insurance increases the users' utility, but it does not result in overall better security.  

The paper \cite{radosavac2008using} also claims that so far in security management of the internet, there is no solution to the residual risk. To solve this the authors come up with an insurance policy, which they claim can survive in a competitive market. However, this solution does not cover the problem of correlated risk.
The actors in the model from \cite{radosavac2008using} are the ISP, who is also the insurer, and the users, the users are of type high- or low-risk users. The question asked is whether a policy that brings profit to the ISPs while protecting the users from risk, exists. Radosavac, et.al find an optimal insurance policy that can be offered to both low and high risk users. Additionally, they also conclude that even when there is an insurance for residual risk, it cannot be guaranteed that a profitable business model exists. 

The paper \cite{danezis2006network} describes an interesting network formation game. Although the paper tries to observe susceptibility to sybil attacks in peer-to-peer networks, the approach used for network formation can be related to our thesis. The game's characteristics is as follows: Nodes are either friends or strangers, and the goal of the nodes is to selfishly try to fulfill own communication needs. The nodes' needs is to communicate with as many as possible of their friends. This can be achieved either by direct or indirect connections. Every node has a link budget, i.e. a maximum number of links it can establish, and a set of friends it wants to connect to. 
\cite{danezis2006network} proposes two random games where nodes might have to take the risk of connecting to non-insured nodes.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Random model: Every node in the network initiates a set of friendships with other nodes, denoted $F$. All nodes have the same link budget $L<F$. 
\item Unbalanced Random Mode. The same friendship graph as in the random model is created. However, one of the nodes has a significantly larger link budget $(L_{0} > 2 F)$
\end{enumerate}
The first model does not result in any equilibrium, except the one where friends only connect to other friends.
The other model shows some new insights, when the link budget is comparable to their number of friends, most nodes still choose to only connect to friends. However, when the link budget is set to only one link, except for the rich node, then the resulting equilibrium is a star topology. 

\subparagraph{Summary.}
There are many different papers that have described the problems of cyber-insurance, and proposed different models and solutions. However, as we revealed, the cyber-insurance market is yet far from established and still has lots of potential. Each of the presented models has a slightly different angle towards improving the cyber-insurance market. Although promising result presented in the papers, few improvements have appeared in the market, and it seems that another approach is needed. This is what we intend to do in this thesis. In brief, we will now investigate whether there are any advantageous structures for cyber-insurance and in chapter 5 see if it is possible for networks to evolve endogenously into these structures.
