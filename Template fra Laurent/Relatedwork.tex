\section{Cyber-Insurance}
\input{relatedworkFinal}
The paper \cite{majuca2006evolution} summarizes the evolution of cyber-insurance. From the early primitive hacker insurance policies, to the modern and comprehensive cyber-insurances. The insurances has evolved, since the insurers have better understanding of the risks and the needs of the businesses. They show how insurers are addressing the adverse selection and moral hazard problem, by classifying the risk level of the insured. They do so by requesting lots of background information about the customers. The paper presents a methodology for calculating the social welfare loss due to adverse selection. The paper are optimistic about the future of cyber-insurance and also concludes that cyber-insurance are making the Internet a safer environment, because insurers are giving users economic incentives to self protect. 

High correlation in failures in information systems is a huge concern to the cyber-insurance market. The paper \cite{bohme2006models} introduces a new classification of correlation properties. They divide it into two levels, the first level is the correlation within firms, and at the second level is the global correlations. They create an economic model for the risk arrival in these two levels, and uses it in simulations to find where a market for cyber-insurance can exist and not. Their results show that cyber-insurance is best suited for risk-classes where the internal correlation is high, and the global correlation is low. This could be one of the reasons for the failure of cyber-insurance, the insurers have focused on the wrong markets, i.e. the markets with high global correlation and low internal correlation. One problem with this paper is that they do not cover interdependent security nor discuss the problem of information asymmetry.  

The papers \cite{bolot2008cyber, bolot2008new}, the authors presents how risk management on the internet only have involved methods to reduce the risks, such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, anti virus etc. But none of these have managed to remove the risk completely. In general there are four possible ways of removing risk: avoid it, retain it, self protect and mitigate it or transfer the risk. Most entities on the internet have chosen a mix of of retaining and mitigate by self protecting. These solutions does not eliminate risk completely, and threats evolve over time. Thus, the only option for completely removing the risk, is to transfer it to a party who willingly accepts it, in exchange for a fee. 
The key-result of these papers is that they show economic reasons for users to not invest in self-protection, and that cyber-insurance will act as an incentive for users to acquire self-protection. I.e. the level of security in the internet will increase with cyber-insurance. The reason for this is that investment in insurance will result in overall higher payoff, and since the premiums discriminates users based on the investment in self protection, it will act as an strong incentive to acquire self protection. 

In contrast to the papers \cite{bolot2008cyber, bolot2008new}, the paper \cite{shetty2010competitive} claims that in a competitive cyber-insurance market the users utility will improve, but the network security will in worsen relative to a market without cyber-insurance. By competitive insurers they mean that there are several insurance contracts to choose from, and user chooses the one that increases their utility the most.
They create two models, in the first one the insurers suffer from information asymmetry regarding the users investment in security. For most of the parameters they uses, there will not be offered any insurance in an equilibrium, due to the moral hazard problem. In their second model, the insurer are able to observe the users security investment, and can thus contract discriminate bad and good users, i.e. no moral hazard is present. In this model the insurance do increase the users utility, but it does not result in overall better security.  

The paper \cite{radosavac2008using} also claims that so far in security management of the internet, there is no solution to the residual risk, and to solve this they come up with an insurance policy, who they claim can survive in a competitive market. However, their solution does not cover the problem of correlated risk.
The actors in their model are the ISP, who also is the insurer, and the users, the users are of type high- or low-risk users. The question they ask is, whether a policy that brings profit to the ISPs while protecting the users from risk exists. They find an optimal insurance policy that can be offered to both low and high risk users. However, they also concludes that even when there is an insurance for residual risk, it cannot be guaranteed that a profitable business model exists. 

The paper \cite{danezis2006network} describes an interesting network formation games. Although the paper tries to observe susceptibility to sybil attacks in peer-to-peer networks, their approach on network formation can be related to our thesis. In their game nodes are either friends or strangers, and the goal of the nodes is to selfishly try to fulfill their communication needs. Their needs is to communicate with as many as possible of their friends. This can be achieved by either direct or indirect connections. Every node has a link budget, i.e. a maximum number of links they can establish, and a set of friends they want to connect to. 
They proposes two random games where nodes might have to take the risk of connecting to non-insured nodes.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Random model: Every node in the network initiate a set for friendships with other nodes, denoted $F$. All nodes have the same link budget $L<F$. 
\item Unbalanced Random Mode. The same friendship graph as in the random model is created. However one of the nodes have a significantly larger link budget $(L_{0} > 2 F)$
\end{enumerate}
The first model does not result in any equilibrium, except the one where friends only connect to other friends.
The other model shows some new insights, when the link budget is comparable with their number of friends, most still choose to only connect to friends. However, when the link budget is set to only one link, except for the rich node. Then the resulting equilibrium is a star topology. 

\subsection{Summary}
There are many different papers that have described the problems of cyber-insurance, and proposed different models and solutions. However, as we revealed, the cyber-insurance market is yet far from established and still has lots of potential. Each of the presented models have a slightly different angel towards improving the cyber-insurance market. Although, promising results from the papers, few improvements have appeared in the market-state, and it seems like another approach is needed. -This is what we intend to do. In brief we will investigate whether there are any advantageous structures and see if it is possible for networks to evolve endogenously into these structures.
