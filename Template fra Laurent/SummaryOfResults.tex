The first model we made, showed a very simple and naive way for the insurer to separate insured and non-insured nodes, into two cliques. By saying that insured only connects to other insured, and non-insured to non-insured. 

 In model-2 we made model-1 realizable, by including the parameters: expected risk cost,insurance cost and the benefit per link. We then analyzed the parameters and found out when and how different network structures would evolve. By adjusting the insurance cost to the right level, the insurer can make the network formation game end up in one clique of both insured and non-insured nodes, or a clique of only insured and another of only non-insured. 
We also showed that when the insurer sets the cost such that the network ends up in two cliques, it is not the socially optimal. Because the network will suffer from the lost benefits of connections between insured and non-insured nodes. 

In model-3 we applied the model to certain real world scenarios, such as software development firms/chains, or other networks where the final product is dependent on the collaboration of several parts.
This was done by including a bonus, which where received when you reached the desired number of links(called max-degree). This made the separation process of insured and non-insured nodes, more difficult for the insurer. In this model the nodes have more incentive to establish links, and are thus more acceptable towards risk. We found the conditions for the different network structures to evolve, and showed that these where strongly dependent on the max-degree. And when the max-degree increases, it gets harder and harder to guarantee two separate cliques.

In Model-4 we tried to make the model more comparable to other insurance products, by including a bulk-discount. The cost of insuring a link are now dependent on the nodes degree. We did this on both model 2 and 3. This resulted in even more incentive, or less disincentive, for insured node to establish links with non-insured nodes, since the cost of doing so decreases as the nodes degree increases. 
We found the different cost conditions for when the different networks will evolve, and showed when applying the discount to model 3, it is very hard for the insurer to ensure two seperate cliques. 
We also showed that the price of stability is even higher when applying discount to model 2. This is because the costs are decreasing, and thus the potential payoff that are missing, when we have two separate cliques, are increasing. 

In our last model we applied our model-4(discount) to an already existing model, "the symmetric connection game". In this old game it had been shown that there exists three different efficient networks that arise under certain cost conditions, and that these also some times where stable. A clique is the most efficient if the cost of establishing links, is less than the benefit gained from indirect connections. A star is the most efficient if the cost is higher than the benefit from indirect connections, but less than the benefit of direct connections. 
It is also shown that as the number of nodes in the networks increase, the probability of the network ending up in star goes to zero. However, By applying our insurance discount to this model, we found a conjecture that says, by setting the cost to the right level, one can with high probability ensure that a star will evolve. 

\section{Conclusion}
\subparagraph{One paragraph stating what you researched and what your original contribution to the field is, after that brake into sections}
One of the many problems with cyber-insurance is to define the risk and calculate premiums, because the network structure is undefined. We have shown how insurers can, by adjusting the insurance cost, determine the result of different network formation games, and even force the network to end up in insurable topologies.  
\subsection{One section on what you researched and how you did it}
We surveyed different literature on networks and risk, and found recent literature who showed how graphs like cliques, star, meta-star and funnel, has a calculable fixation probability. And that the star-structures act as an evolutionary amplifier. 
With these structures in mind, we created and analyzed different network formation games, and tried to find link-cost constraints, that enabled these structures to evolve. 
The analyzis where performed mathematically by using game-theory and confirming the results with a simulator created in netlogo.
We analyzed five different models, started with a very simple model, and then made it more complex and realistic for every step. 
\subsection{One section on what are the main findings were… showinglinks across chapters (this explains why you chose thestructure you did)}
In model one to four, we found cost constraints for different types of networks to evolve. And in all scenarios it is possible for the insurer to set the cost, such that the game will end up in two cliques, one consisting of insured and the other of non-insured. 
In every model we added some new features that made the model more applicable to real world scenarios, and for every feature added it became more difficult for the insurer to separate the two types of nodes. This is due to the increase in incentive of establishin links, and thus the nodes became more and more acceptable towards risk. From this findings we could see that the price of stability also increased. 
We also showed that to be able to separate the networks into two cliques, the nodes must know the other nodes types. Or else, the nodes will have incentive to pretend to be an insured node. This will result in risky links between insured and non-insured nodes. 

In the last model we introduced the concept of bulk-insurance into an already existing networkformation game, the connection game, and showed that this would drastically increase the probability of the network ending up in star. This is because at a point, called critical degree, the nodes optimal strategy will change from being relaying on indirect connections to increase its payoff, to suddenly wanting to connect to everyone. 
We proved this by performing multiple simulations, and these simulations showed that in a network with twenty nodes, the network would result in a star with high probability, from critical degree six and up. 
Whats makes this a very interesting finding, is that it is earlier proven that in the connection game, the probability of the network reaching a star goes towards zero as the number of nodes increases. But by introducing a discount, that will subsidize the center node, the game will with high probability end up in a star, given the critical degree is reached at the right level. \textbf{MUST DEFINE WHERE THIS LEVEL IS}

\subsection{One section on possible areas for future research}
On suggestion for future work, is mapping our models and simulations to real world scenarios in a more convincing way. Because real world network are not random, nodes may prefer to talk to nodes with high degree or low degree, i.e. the payoff function has to be changed. We have assumed additive benefits and risk, so suggestions for future work could be to introduce different risk and benefit functions, that are more applicable to the real world. 
Another interesting thing to research, is the game of choosing insurance or not, in future work this could be applied to our models.
 
\subsection{Final section reminding readers of the original contributionand significance of your research to your field}
We have shown how an insurer can determine the resulting network structure, like separate insured and non-insured nodes into two cliques, by adjusting the insurance cost parameter. In this way the network can be considered as an insurable topology, since it enables the insurer to calculate the probability of fixation. 
We found these conditions for several models, with different aspects that relate them to real world and other insurance products.
