\section{Discussion}
From our background study it was relieved that the current market for cyber-insurance is far from healthy, and many people are skeptical about the future of cyber-insurance. We believe that there is a need for cyber-insurance, since it is impossible to ensure 100 percent security. As described in the introduction, there are certain obstacles unique for cyber-insurance, and arguably these are the reasons why cyber-insurance have not emerged as expected. In light of earlier failed attempts to establish a cyber-insurance market, such as those we found here in Norway, we wanted to take a new approach towards analyzing the cyber-insurance market. 

First we studied a variety of different network formation games, in order to find out if there where any superior network topologies that would fit as a cyber-insurance network. -Where ideally both the insurer and customers gets a higher payoff from purchasing cyber-insurance. As described in the background study, we found that star and clique structures had appropriate characteristics, not only do they have calculable fixation probability, but they could also generate better security and overall higher payoff for the nodes. With these structures in mind, we wanted to find a way of forcing networks to evolve into these structures.  We found that insurers could use the insurance premium in order to control the formation of networks. If the price is set to the right level, networks with calculable risk will evolve, and if the insurer are able to separate the nodes into two different network, one consisting of trusted, insured nodes, the other of non-insured nodes, the trusted nodes can even further increase their payoff. The insurer now posses a tool for setting the insurance premium properly, resulting in possible better products for both the customer and the insurer.

We created several different models, where the first model, showed a very simple and naive way for the insurer to separate insured and non-insured nodes, into two cliques. In the other models we added more and more features, to make them more applicable to real world scenarios. To get an overview of the models we created, we refer to the Figure \ref{fig:Overview-of-models}. 

 In model-2 we made model-1 realizable, by including the parameters: expected risk cost,insurance cost and the benefit per link. We then analyzed the parameters and found out when and how different network structures would evolve. By adjusting the insurance cost to the right level, the insurer can make the network formation game end up in one clique of both insured and non-insured nodes, or a clique of only insured and another of only non-insured. The condition for separating insured from non-insured are: $\beta-r<I_{l}<\beta$, and if also $\beta>r$, then the resulting network will be two cliques. The solution is also stable, since the resulting network consist of one or two cliques, there is not possible to add any more links. And because the change in payoff is linear and non-dependent on the rest of the network,   when a link is added, there is no reason to remove it later. This holds for model 1,2,3 and 4.
We also showed that when the insurer sets the cost such that the network ends up in two cliques, it is not the socially optimal. Because the network will suffer from the lost benefits of connections between insured and non-insured nodes.

In model-3 we applied the model to certain real world scenarios, such as software development firms/chains, or other networks where the final product is dependent on the collaboration of several partners.
This was done by including a bonus, which is received when a node reach the desired number of links(called max-degree). This made the separation process of insured and non-insured nodes more difficult for the insurer. Due to the possibility of reaching the bonus, a node will have more incentive to establish links, and are thus more acceptable towards establishing connections to risky nodes. The condition for separating insured and non-insured nodes are: $\beta+\gamma-r<I_{l}<\beta+\frac{\gamma}{m}$. For the separation to be possible, $1-\frac{1}{m}<\frac{r}{m}$, and as we see as $\gamma$ and/or $m$ increases, this gets more and more difficult to achieve. 
The condition are strongly dependent on the max-degree. When the max-degree and bonus increases , it gets harder and harder to guarantee separation of insured and non-insured nodes. 

In Model-4 we tried to implement a common feature used by insurance companies, bulk-discount, in order to see how this affected the network formation. The cost of insuring a link are now dependent on the nodes degree. We implemented this feature on both model 2 and 3, which resulted in even more incentive, or less disincentive, for an insured node to establish links with non-insured nodes. The reason is intuitive since the cost of doing so decreases as the nodes degree increases. 
When we applied the discount on model 2, the condition for ensuring separation of insured and non-insured nodes were: $N_{I}(\beta-r)<I_{l}<\beta$, where $N_{I}$ represents the number of insured nodes in the network. This is a very strong condition, because we for the separation to be possible this has to hold: $N_{I}(\beta-r)<\beta$ . For this to be true for a large number of insured nodes, we see that $\beta$ need to be just slightly bigger than $r$. And as we see, it is now more difficult for the insurer to separate insured and non-insured, compared to model 2.

When applying the discount to model 3, this is the condition to ensure separation: $m(\beta+\gamma-r)<I_{l}<\beta+\frac{\gamma}{m}$, and as in the other models, this further complicates the separation process for the insurer. 

We also showed that the price of anarchy is even higher when applying discount to model 2. This is because the costs are decreasing, and thus when we have two separate cliques the potential lost payoff between them will increase.
We where not able to calculate the price of anarchy in model 3, because the calculation of the optimal solution is to complex when the bonus and max degree is introduced. However, we can see that since the incentive for establishing links have increased, and thus the insurer has to set a higher price to compensate for this, the price of anarchy will be present. The same holds when we apply the discount to model 3, because this only further increases the incentive of establishing links, i.e. it gets harder to ensure separation of the nodes.  

In our last model we applied our model-4(discount) to an already existing model, "the symmetric connection game". In this old game it has been shown that there exists three different efficient and stable networks, clique, star and an empty network, that arise under certain cost conditions. If $I_{l}<\beta-\beta^{2}$, the efficient and stable network is a clique. If $\beta-\beta^{2}<I_{l}<\beta$ a star is both stable and efficient. If $\beta+\frac{N-2}{2}\beta^{2}$ an empty network is both stable and efficient. In general a clique is the most efficient if the cost of establishing links, is less than the benefit gained from indirect connections. A star is the most efficient if the cost is higher than the benefit from indirect connections, but less than the benefit of direct connections. 
However, it is proved that as the number of nodes in the networks increase, the probability of the network ending up in star goes to zero. But when we applied our insurance discount to this model, we found a conjecture that says, by setting the cost to the right level, one can with high probability ensure that a star will evolve. This changes the connection game drastically for the insurer, because he is now able to force the network into two possible network formations. Where the star has a fixation probability that exceeds the cliques. The insurer can use these findings to ensure that a star or a clique evolves. If the insurer are able to force a star to evolve, this can be used to drastically increase the overall security, and at the same time minimizing the overall link-cost. 

\subparagraph{Limitations and future work}
One limitation to our work, and a suggestion for future work, is mapping our models and simulations to real world networks in a more convincing way. Real world network are not random, nodes may prefer to talk to nodes with high degree or low degree, i.e. the payoff function has to be changed. 

Another limitation and suggestion for future work, is that we have assumed additive risk. It is reasonable to assume that the probability of failure increases if a node accepts more and more links to non-trusted nodes. However, whether the risk parameter increases according to an additive distribution, exponential, logarithmic or something completely different we where not able to determine. And by introducing a complex risk function, we would only have distorted the goal of the models. The decision of using additive risk was take due to the simplicity of the function and the fact that we do not know for sure how the distribution actually looks like.
So suggestions for future work is to introduce different risk parameter, that are more applicable to the real world.

Another interesting thing to research, is the game of choosing insurance or not, in future work this could be applied to our models, however this could possibly be too complex, and only disrupt the models.

\section{Conclusion}

One of the many problems with cyber-insurance is to define the risk and calculate premiums, we think that by being able to both identify and force certain network structures to evolve, this could be easier to achieve.
We surveyed different literature on networks and risk, and found recent literature who showed how graphs like cliques, star, super-star, funnel and meta-funnel, all have a calculable fixation probability, and that stars and funnels fixation probability exceeds the one of a clique. 
With these structures in mind, we created and analyzed different network formation games, and tried to find link-cost constraints, that enabled these structures to evolve. 
The analyzis where performed mathematically by using game-theory and confirming the results with a simulator created in NetLogo.

We created and analyzed five different models, starting with a very simple model, and step wise made it more complex and realistic. 
  
In model one to four, we found cost constraints to separate insured and non-insured nodes into two cliques. 
In every model we added some new features that made the model more applicable to real world scenarios, and for every feature added it became more difficult for the insurer to separate the two types of nodes. This is due to the increased incentive for establishing links, and thus the nodes became more and more acceptable towards risk. 
We also showed that to be able to separate the networks into two cliques, the nodes must know the other nodes types. Or else, the nodes will have incentive to pretend to be an insured node, regardless of type, which will result in a untrusted network. 

In the last model we introduced the concept of bulk-insurance into an already existing network formation game, the connection game, and showed that this enabled the insurer to determine, with high probability, when and how, cliques, stars or scale-free network would evolve with. We showed that at a point, called critical degree, a nodes optimal strategy will change from relaying on indirect connections, to suddenly wanting to connect to everyone. If the critical degree is set to the right level, one can ensure that the different structures evolve. If the critical degree is set to a low degree, a clique will most certainly evolve, at a medium level a star will evolve, and at a high level a scale-free network will evolve. We proved this by performing multiple simulations, 50 simulations for every critical degree.  
What makes this an even more interesting finding, is that it is earlier proven that in the connection game, the probability of the network reaching a star goes towards zero as the number of nodes increases. However by introducing a discount, that will subsidize the center node, one can drastically increase the probability of the network ending up in a star.

In summary we have shown how insurers can, by adjusting the insurance cost, determine the resulting networks for different network formation games. And at the same time helping the insurer calculating the overall probability of fixation.
We found these conditions for several models, with different aspects that relate them to real world and other insurance products. We believe our findings can help the cyber-insurance market evolve into the state everyone thought it would reach.
